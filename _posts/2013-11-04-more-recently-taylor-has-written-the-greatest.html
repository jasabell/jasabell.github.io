<blockquote>More recently, Taylor has written the greatest work yet completed on the secular reality of our times. In <em>A Secular Age</em>, he describes three successive sets of intellectual conditions. In the first, associated with the Premodern Age of antiquity and the medieval synthesis, it was <em>impossible not to believe.</em> There was simply no intellectual alternative to theism in the West. There was no alternative set of explanations for the world and its operations, or for moral order. All that changed with the arrival of modernity. In the Modern Age it became <em>possible not to believe.</em> A secular alternative to Christian theism emerged as a real choice. As a matter of fact, choice now ruled the intellectual field. As Peter Berger famously observed decades ago, this is the “heretical imperative,” the imperative to choose. The third set of intellectual conditions is identified with late modernity and our own intellectual epoch. For most people living in the context of self-conscious late modernity, it is now <em>impossible to believe.</em><br/><br/>
This is  a stunning intellectual and moral revolution. It defies exaggeration. We must recognize that it is far more pervasive than we might want to believe, for this intellectual revolution has changed the worldviews of even those who believe themselves to be opposed to it. If nothing else, many religious believers in modern societies now operate as theological and ideological consumers, constantly shopping for new intellectual clothing, even as they believe themselves to be traditional believers. Everything is now reduced to choice, and choice is, as Taylor reminds us, central to the moral project of late modernity, the project of individual <em>authenticity.</em></blockquote>&#8212;<p><a href="http://www.worldviewchurch.org/wvc-digest/featured-articles/20655-a-clear-and-present-danger-an-address-at-brigham-young-university?print=1&amp;tmpl=component">A Clear and Present Danger &hellip; An Address at Brigham Young University</a> Al Mohler talks as a Christian to the Brigham Young University.</p>

<p>This quote reflects—in a far more sophisticated way—recent thoughts I have had as I think about launching my growing children. I somewhat recognize how the air we breath has impacted my kids despite my attempts to the contrary, but what I struggle to see is how modern thinking and the air we breath has <em>affected what I think and believe.</em></p>
