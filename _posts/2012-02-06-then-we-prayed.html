I have written this before, and will probably write it again: Andrew Peterson is one of my favorite musicians and authors. We have most of his albums and all his novels. He is a gift to the church. He has been working on a new album (yay!) and wrote this about how they started...<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">I’m 37 years old. This isn’t my first rodeo. I shouldn’t feel that old fear, anxiety, or self-doubt, should I? Then again, maybe I should. As soon as you think you know what you’re doing, you’re in big trouble. So before we opened a single guitar case, we talked. I sat with Ben Shive, Andy Gullahorn, and Cason and told them I felt awfully unprepared. I doubted the songs. I was nervous about the musical direction the record seemed to want to take. I wondered if I was up to the task. I told them about the theme that had arisen in many of the songs: loss of innocence, the grief of growing up, the ache for the coming Kingdom, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sehnsucht"><i>sehnsucht</i></a> I experience when I see my children on the cusp of the thousand joys and the thousand heartaches of young-adulthood.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Then we prayed. We asked for help. Ever since I read Lanier Ivester’s beautiful post about Bach (<a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/2011/03/guest-post-face-down/">if you haven’t read it, you must</a>), I’ve written the words “Jesu juva” in my journal when I’m writing a lyric. It’s latin for “Jesus, help!”, and there’s no better prayer for the beginning of an adventure. Jesus, you’re the source of beauty: help us make something beautiful; Jesus, you’re the Word that was with God in the beginning, the Word that made all creation: give us words and be with us in this beginning of this creation; Jesus, you’re the light of the world: light our way into this mystery; Jesus, you love perfectly and with perfect humility: let this imperfect music bear your perfect love to every ear that hears it.<br />We said, “Amen.”&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Then I took a deep breath, opened the guitar case, and leapt.</blockquote>It’s obvious why I like him, right? (Not to mention he likes Pink Floyd’s <i>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</i>.)<br /><br />Read the whole <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/2012/02/how-to-make-a-record-part-1-first-things-first/">Rabbit Room</a> post.<br />
