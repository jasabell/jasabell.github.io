We hope that the first week of your year is going well.<br /><br />All of last semester, I have been the teacher's assistant for Pastor Tom Steller's two classes on Wednesday nights.  Wendy has been taking the classes.  Because we have been in these classes, Wendy and I have not been able to attend the regular Wednesday night service.  Last night we attended the first Wednesday service of the new year, and our first service in over five months.  The Wednesday night services are a lot different than Sunday morning, but they are still wonderful.  They are more homey, and we worship, and have some teaching time, and usually, get to watch a few baptisms.<br /><br />Last night there were two baptisms.  It was obvious that both of these people truly understood the magnitude of their sin and the magnitude of the covering afforded to them by Christ's death and resurrection.  It was an honor and a joy to hear their testimonies and see them take the step of faith in being baptized.<br /><br />Next week Wendy and I will be back in classes.  That is good, but also sad, because we realized how much we missed the worship services on Wednesday night.
