“My job as a writer is to whittle my story down to the bare truth at its heart and then build around it the best illusions I can muster, illusions that support and even illuminate without distracting. The failure to understand this is precisely why so many films fall flat—the storyteller is enraptured by his own illusion and forgets to paint the truth. If there’s not a kernel of truth at the heart of the story, then all the action sequences, precise prose, and emotionally manipulative music on earth can’t save it.”<br /><br />—Pete Peterson, <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/">The Rabbit Room</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/2012/03/truth-in-the-guise-of-illusion/"><i>Truth in the Guise of Illusion</i></a>
