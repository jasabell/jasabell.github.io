My son and I have been competing on an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/">iPod Touch</a> app called <a href="http://www.epicgames.com/infinityblade/">Infinity Blade</a>. I taunted him last night because I reached level 45 and obtained the Infinity Blade—the highest rated sword—before he did and while he watched. I then promptly lost to the god-king who is rated at level 150 while he watched.<br /><br />I received the following email this afternoon...<br /><blockquote>I KILLED THE GOD KING! I KILLED THE GOD KING! LEVEL 150! WITH THE WEAKEST SWORD! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</blockquote>
