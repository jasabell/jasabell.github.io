Charles Colson writes today in his <a href="http://www.breakpoint.org/bpcommentaries/entry/13/16195">BreakPoint</a> article,<br /><blockquote>Since 1973, [Walter Hoy] notes, over 14.5 million black babies have been killed by abortion. Every, single day, 1,200 black babies are put to death in abortion facilities, making abortion the leading cause of death among African Americans! Nearly half of all black babies concieved die in abortion chambers today. Hoy says this means that a black child is safer on the streets of the worst neighborhoods in American than in his mother's womb.</blockquote>
