<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Fee">Gordon Fee</a> writes regarding the chapter break at 1 Thess 2:1:<br /><blockquote>While these aid in "finding" things, they are unfortunate in that they cause people to read the Bible differently from the way they would read anything else; and, as here, they often create false divisions of thought. Even the language "chapter and verse" unwittingly advocates a kind of gnomic approach to Scripture that gets in the way of good reading. By taking out the numbers, one can easily see what Paul is concerned with.<br /></blockquote>â€”Gordon Fee, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EyhthfhtayIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">The First and Second Letters to the Thessalonians</a>, NICNT, 51
