I had the amazing privilege of learning from <a href="http://www.sbts.edu/Academics/Faculty/Theology/Thomas_Schreiner.aspx">Dr. Tom Schreiner</a> this past week.  I took a modular class on Galatians where we spent 9 months translating, diagramming and arcing our way through the Greek text.  Then last week, for four hours a day for five days, Dr. Schreiner walked through the text with us and discussed every detail.  It was such a joy.<br /><br />Dr. Schreiner is currently working on a commentary on Galatians for a new commentary series to be published by Zondervan.  The genius of this commentary series is that each commentary will be based on arcing or tracing the argument.<br /><br />Not only was Dr. Schreiner brilliant, but he exuded Christian character.  He was kind and polite, humble and happy.  Our whole family picked him up at the airport and he genuinely seemed interested in talking with my kids.  He has been a hero of mine since I taught through his Romans commentary at Brush Prairie Baptist Church about seven years ago.
