<blockquote>But there’s more here than just an irrational fear of people with lots of kids. “Ah yes,” Hemingway points out with a little snark of her own: “How ‘intensely weird’ it is for an NFL player to be having his seventh kid. Except that it isn’t weird at all for an NFL player to have his seventh kid. It’s only weird for an NFL player to have seven kids with his <em>one wife.</em>”</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://www.breakpoint.org/bpcommentaries/entry/13/23713">John Stonestreet</a>
