I see craft in the world. I cannot watch dust swirl on the sidewalk without seeing God drag His finger, or listen to spring rain running in the streets without hearing Him roll his <span style="font-style: italic;">R</span>s. For those who believe in an <span style="font-style: italic;">ex nihilo</span> creation, the world is inevitably art, and it is inevitably art from top to bottom, in every time and in every place. The world cannot exist apart from the voice of God. It is the voicings of God.<br /><br />â€”N. D. Wilson, <span style="font-style: italic;">Notes from the Tilt-A-Whirl</span>, p. 98
