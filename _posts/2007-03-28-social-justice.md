When most of us think of social justice we think of Darfur or human trafficking or the right-to-life.   However, I wonder if <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/news/story?seriesId=99&id=2814204&amp;campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines">this</a> article shows another form of social justice...<br /><br />Key quote: "I went to my trailer for about 15 minutes and I thought, there's people dying every day.  A lot of worse things are happening in the world."
