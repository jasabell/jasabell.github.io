I am thankful that a I have the opportunity to work from home a day or two per week. In January an average fill-up at the gas station ran me $53. Today it is running $72 per tank.<br /><br />We have noticed a similar increase in food prices. Prices have increased somewhat dramatically from week to week, while we are purchasing the same set of staple foods. Between food and gas, our family of six is feeling the pinch. What choices do I have to save money?<br /><br />1. Drive less. Plan trips accordingly. Work from home.<br />2. Buy a more gas efficient vehicle. Hmmm. Not very practical.<br />3. Ride a bike. It’s cold 9 months out of 12.<br />4. Eat less. Don’t let my 13-year old son have free reign over the fridge.<br />5. Use more coupons. Lots of work; could be helpful.<br />6. Charge my kids rent. Child labor laws?<br />7. Get a second job. Not realistic.<br />8. ????<br /><br />What are you doing to fend off higher prices at the grocery store and the gas pump?
