“G.K. Chesterton said somewhere that if a book does not have&nbsp;a wicked character in it, then it is a&nbsp;wicked book. One of the most pernicious errors that has gotten abroad in&nbsp;the Christian community is the error&nbsp;of sentimentalism—the view that evil&nbsp;is to be evaded, rather than the more&nbsp;robust Christian view that evil is to be&nbsp;conquered. The Christian believes that evil is there to be fought, the dragon is there to be slain. The sentimentalist believes that evil is to be resented.”<br /><br />—Douglas Wilson, “Forward”, <i>Omnibus IV</i>, page IX.
