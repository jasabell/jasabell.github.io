People think I am just an Apple fanboy, which I am, but it is because of people like Joni Ive. <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/02/20/jonathan-ive-on-apples-design-philosophy/">TUAW</a>&nbsp;recently wrote this:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">In a May 2012 interview with the Telegraph, Ive said, “We’re keenly aware that when we develop and make something and bring it to market that it really does speak to a set of values. And what preoccupies us is that sense of care, and what our products will not speak to is a schedule, what our products will not speak to is trying to respond to some corporate or competitive agenda. We’re very genuinely designing the best products that we can for people.”</blockquote>
