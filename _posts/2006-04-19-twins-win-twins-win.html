Last Saturday night, April 15, Chase and I had the good pleasure of attending a Minnesota Twins baseball game in the Metrodome.  The Twins were playing the Yankees, who happen to be Chase's favorite baseball team.  I am sure that this is a travesty to Alex Bejerano and Tim Wines, who taught me to enjoy baseball, and consequently hated the Yankees.  Oh, well.  I think Chase mostly likes the Yankees because they have a bunch of former Seattle Mariners.<br /><br />The Twins started out very well, getting up to a quick 4-0 lead.  Unfortunately, they couldn't hold their lead, and ended up down by one, 5-4, going into the ninth inning.<br /><br />The Twins were able to hold off the Yankees in the eighth inning.  The Yanks brought in Mariano Rivera at the end of the eighth to try for a five-out save.  He shut the Twins down.<br /><br />On to the ninth.  Yankees were at bat first, and were taken care of relatively easily.  Three outs left for the home team.  The first guy (I don't know their names; I am not from Minnesota) got on base.  The second guy got on base.  Then the king of saves, Mariano Rivera, struck out the next two Twins batters.  The situation was this: down by one, bottom of the ninth, two outs, and facing arguably the games' best closer.  The Metrodome was so loud you couldn't hear yourself yell.<br /><br />The fifth batter hit a single to right field driving in both runs to win the game. <br /><br />Twins Win!  Twins Win!<br /><br />Chase was bummed, for the mighty Yankees fell, but the two of us, we had a great time.  It is good to be a dad.
