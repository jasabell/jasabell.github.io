<blockquote>That increased satisfaction, however, may merely mask the fact that younger workers also suffer in open offices. In <a href="http://www.informedesign.org/Rs_detail.aspx?rsId=2366">a 2005</a> study, the psychologists Alena Maher and Courtney von Hippel found that the better you are at screening out distractions, the more effectively you work in an open office. Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15583.full">it seems that</a> the more frantically you multitask, the worse you become at blocking out distractions. Moreover, according to the Stanford University cognitive neuroscientist Anthony Wagner, heavy multitaskers are not only “more susceptible to interference from irrelevant environmental stimuli” but also worse at switching between unrelated tasks. In other words, if habitual multitaskers are interrupted by a colleague, it takes them longer to settle back into what they were doing. Regardless of age, when we’re exposed to too many inputs at once—a computer screen, music, a colleague’s conversation, the ping of an instant message—our senses become overloaded, and it requires <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119992592.ch6/summary">more work to achieve a given result</a>.</blockquote>&#8212;<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/2014/01/the-open-office-trap.html?mobify=0">THE OPEN-OFFICE TRAP</a> in The New Yorker.</p>
