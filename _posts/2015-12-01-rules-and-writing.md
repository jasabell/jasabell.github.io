> When I make first contact with my students, I tell them that there are no rules anymore because they never existed in the first place, but there are guidelines and goals, and that the rules are to be rewritten each time they sit down to write in a particular rhetorical situation grounded in audience, genre, and purpose/occasion.

&mdash; [John Warner][JohnWarner], [The High School/College Writing Classroom Disconnect][writing], Inside Higher Ed. *I wish that I had read this a couple years ago when I was first starting to teach writing to college students. I made some of the high school mistakes he talks about. If I ever get a chance to teach writing again, I would do things differently.*
