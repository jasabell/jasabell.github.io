I ran across this poem by Gerald Costanzo the other day and it made me long for the Pacific Northwest. I grew up just outside of Portland, but my dad lived there and we would often go to Washington Park. We walked the train tracks between the park and the zoo, jumping out to scare the train goers. We would read the names and dates of all the Queens of Rosaria. In 2011, I took my family and we spent an afternoon in the park. I realized again how beautiful it is.<br /><br /><b>Washington Park</b><br /><br />I went walking in the Rose Gardens.<br />It was about to rain, but the roses<br />were beginning to bloom. The Olympiads,<br /><br />some Shreveports, and the Royal<br />Sunsets. This was in the beautiful<br />city I had taken away from myself<br /><br />years before, and now I was giving it back.<br />I walked over the Rosaria tiles<br />and found Queen Joan of 1945. I sat<br /><br />on the hillside overlooking the reservoir<br />and studied the Willamette and the Douglas<br />firs. I learned the traffic<br /><br />and the new highrises as the rain<br />came down.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This leaving and returning,<br /><br />years of anger and forgiveness,<br />the attempts to forgive one’s self—<br />it’s everybody’s story,<br /><br />and I was sitting there<br />filling up again with the part of it<br />that was mine.<br /><br />—Gerald Costanzo, from <i>Nobody Lives on Arthur Godfrey Boulevard</i>, Rochester NY: BOA Editions, Ltd., 1992.
