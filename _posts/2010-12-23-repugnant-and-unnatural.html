<div>From <a href="http://ayjay.tumblr.com/post/2403097050/there-are-many-people-happy-people-it-usually">AyJay's</a> "more than 95 theses"...</div><blockquote>“There are many people – happy people, it usually appears – whose thoughts at Christmas always turn to books. The notion of a Christmas tree with no books under it is repugnant and unnatural to them.”</blockquote><blockquote>- (via <a href="http://wwnorton.tumblr.com/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black;">wwnorton</span></a>)</blockquote>(Source: evidenceanecdotal.blogspot.com)
