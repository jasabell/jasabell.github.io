“A paradoxical noun because it means beauty but is itself one of the ugliest words in the language. Same goes for the adjectival form <i>pulchritudinous</i>. They’re part of a tiny elite cadre of words that possess the very opposite of the qualities they denote. <i>Diminutive</i>, <i>big</i>, <i>foreign</i>, <i>fancy</i> (adjective), <i>colloquialism</i>, and <i>monosyllabic</i> are some others; there are at least a dozen more. Inviting your school-age kids to list as many paradoxical words as they can is a neat way to deepen their relationship to English and help them see that words are both symbols for things and very real things themselves.”<br /><br />I found this brief, interesting paragraph in the Mac OS X Dictionary program when I looked up “Beauty” in the Thesaurus. It was cool enough to post. I love the thought that words are “both symbols for things and very real things themselves.”
