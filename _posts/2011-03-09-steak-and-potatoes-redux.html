Back at the end of January, I attempted to barbecue steak and potatoes. You can read about the attendant failures <a href="http://theabellsix.blogspot.com/2011/01/barbecued-ribeye-steak-with-red.html">here</a>. The disappointments of that cold January night had been haunting me; I needed a rematch. So, this last weekend, I prepared for a do over.<br /><br />I shopped for steaks at Von Hansons on 96, I purchased all the proper ingredients, and we were bold enough to invite friends.<br /><br />Again, the potatoes were grilled to perfection. This time, however, they were tossed with the proper dressing with proper ingredients. Magnificent.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-KejWmIMROVQ/TXgl-IzLtsI/AAAAAAAAALI/OjTvjA0uHEA/s1600/Potatoes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-KejWmIMROVQ/TXgl-IzLtsI/AAAAAAAAALI/OjTvjA0uHEA/s320/Potatoes.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Finally, the steaks were watched like a hawk. I am not a steak lover, but Wendy liked them and the company seemed OK.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7RwufmYFbEs/TXgl_9D2i9I/AAAAAAAAALM/QQqQIDOwKME/s1600/Steak.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7RwufmYFbEs/TXgl_9D2i9I/AAAAAAAAALM/QQqQIDOwKME/s320/Steak.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Overall, we will call it a success.
