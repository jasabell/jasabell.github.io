Grilling has been a significant delight now for several years. As my skills have increased (marginally, I know), I have desired to grill a wider variety of foods; foods that would require hours of “low and slow” goodness.<br /><br />Yet due to my impatient personality, I have focused most of my grilling on relatively quick and super-hot cooking techniques. (Yes, I just wrote <i>super</i>-hot, but I didn’t mean it like <i>super</i>-cute.) After all, it is pretty easy to build a hot fire and quickly sear meat. To my shame, I have not attempted to cook many meats that require hours or even all day in a smoky, low temperature fire. The longest meal I have ever cooked has been the turkey on Thanksgiving, which only required about 2 hours.<br /><br />I knew that in order to barbecue cuts of meat that needed six or eight hours I would have to manage the heat of the coals better than I typically manage my Saturday mornings. Frankly, I have not been happy with my success in cooking ribs, so my desires have leaned toward having a thermometer built into the grill lid. I tried using an oven thermometer with little success as it always got in the way of the actual food on the grill, not to mention turning a dark shade of dirty orange from the smoke.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1himSab8--s/TzXETAr0LBI/AAAAAAAAANU/FZ7DyY1rKls/s1600/DYI-Thermometer+1.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1himSab8--s/TzXETAr0LBI/AAAAAAAAANU/FZ7DyY1rKls/s400/DYI-Thermometer+1.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />My eyes started to wander away from my faithful grill towards one of those pretty models in the store that had a built in thermometer. I love Weber and want to stay with the brand. At the same time I realize that the brand name is expensive and they designed their line of charcoal grills to pull as much money from my wallet as possible. Hence only the most expensive models include the relatively cheap thermometer.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419Bt98Vm3L._SL500_AA300_.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419Bt98Vm3L._SL500_AA300_.jpg" /></a></div><br /><br />As much as I wanted a grill with a thermometer, I could not justify spending $300 on a second grill with a thermometer. Don’t get me wrong, I <i>can</i>&nbsp;justify a second grill; just not a $300 one.<br /><br />Well, I explained my dilemma to the helpful men at <a href="http://frattallones.com/">Frattalone’s</a> Ace Hardware in Arden Hills and we landed on an inexpensive, if somewhat DIY solution. Weber does sell a replacement thermometer for their gas grills, which would do the job perfectly.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_uD1ANp9YCE/TzXEVmwuJsI/AAAAAAAAANc/izvYbz4bZEc/s1600/DYI-Thermometer+2.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_uD1ANp9YCE/TzXEVmwuJsI/AAAAAAAAANc/izvYbz4bZEc/s400/DYI-Thermometer+2.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />So, I took things into my owns hands, in the suburban American weekend warrior sort of way.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1gHlZ_KA4JE/TzXEXjstzKI/AAAAAAAAANk/06tI81edI3s/s1600/DYI-Thermometer+3.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1gHlZ_KA4JE/TzXEXjstzKI/AAAAAAAAANk/06tI81edI3s/s400/DYI-Thermometer+3.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rhOdi9lFfUM/TzXEabUZbNI/AAAAAAAAANs/BD1Y8FV1Kc0/s1600/DYI-Thermometer+4.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rhOdi9lFfUM/TzXEabUZbNI/AAAAAAAAANs/BD1Y8FV1Kc0/s400/DYI-Thermometer+4.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />Mission accomplished.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0wVtXKC9QGE/TzXEefsGaaI/AAAAAAAAAN0/luUDBXNP5Y4/s1600/DYI-Thermometer+5.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0wVtXKC9QGE/TzXEefsGaaI/AAAAAAAAAN0/luUDBXNP5Y4/s400/DYI-Thermometer+5.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />
