This week, someone close enough to know some particulars about our life gave us a gift anonymously. Since we don't know who you are, we are spreading our thanksgiving.<br /><br />Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br /><br />The fact that this person is anonymous does not diminish our thankfulness. Nor does it diminish our knowledge that the gift was given in love, love that first came from our savior Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Thank you, whoever your are, in Christ.<br /><br />The Abell Six
