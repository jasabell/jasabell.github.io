On Thursday, I took my last final for the Reading the Greek New Testament class.  It took almost three hours.  After that I was pretty drained.  Fortunately, Wendy and I had a babysitter lined up and we were able to go out to <a href="http://www.chipotle.com/">Chipotle</a> our new favorite fast food restaurant.  Apparently, there is one in Portland, so y'all might want to try it out.  I don't think it beats Peppers, but since Peppers isn't in MN, we have to do our best.<br /><br />After big burritos, we went to see Narnia.  We thought that we should preview it before we take the kids, and it was a good idea, because neither Kayleigh nor Brooke would have lasted past the first few minutes.<br /><br />I don't have classes again until January 9, so we are going to try and spend some much needed family time together.  The kids are waiting for me to finish this post so we can play.  I have a lot more to say, but it will have to wait until later.<br /><br />It is our prayer that you see and savor the wonder of the Christ-child this weekend.<br /><br />Merry Christmas!
