"Most denominations have done studies in worship and may even review it frequently; they have also produced books that set forth their worship and their hymns.  This is as it should be, of course.  But all worshippers need to discover for themselves what worship is all about and how to improve it, and this must come from the Bible itself.  <span style="font-style:italic;">After all, our worship of God must continue to develop throughout life</span>" (Allen P. Ross, <span style="font-style:italic;">Recalling the Hope of Glory</span>, p. 63n2, emphasis mine).
