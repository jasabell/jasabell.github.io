There is a good deal to be said for excluding literature from school curricula altogether. I am not sure that the best way to make a boy love the English poets might not be to forbid him to read them and then make sure that he had plenty of opportunities to disobey you.<br /><br />â€”C. S. Lewis, "The Parthenon and the Optative," <span style="font-style: italic;">On Stories and Other Essays on Literature</span>, p. 111.
