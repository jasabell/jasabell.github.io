Five of the Abell six have now completed N. D. Wilson’s latest fictional creation, <i>The Dragon’s Tooth.</i>&nbsp;Unanimous consensus is that this book is simply fantastic. Nate wrote, upon request from Amazon, a brief letter to potential readers. I suggest you read the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dragons-Tooth-Ashtown-Burials/dp/0375864393/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317184193&amp;sr=1-1">whole thing</a>, but here is a great paragraph:<blockquote>Escapism in fiction can be a beautiful thing. But that’s not the only thing I hope to create. If kids around the world pass through The Dragon’s Tooth and become friends with Cyrus and Antigone Smith and form clubs and sit in circles to role-play with dice and wish they had more interesting lives, then I will have failed. But if they dream of learning to sail, to swim, to fly, if they dream of running faster than they’ve ever run and studying Latin (or Greek or Persian or Creole), if they walk outside and realize that their world is more wonderful, more surprising, more dangerous, and more exciting than anything I could ever create, if they discover that they themselves could become more interesting than any character I could ever shape, then I will have succeeded.</blockquote>One of my daughters said that “Cyrus Smith, if he were real, was the kind of boy you could fall in love with...”<br /><br />I love being a dad that gets to read the same great stuff his kids are reading. I love the excitement and fun we have discussing plots and characters and story lines. I love being a dad to my four and the head of the Abell six.
