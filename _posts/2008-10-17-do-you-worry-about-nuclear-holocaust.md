Apparently, there are still people who worry about nuclear holocaust and the extinction of mankind, including some prominent American politicians.  Read Chuck Colson's article on <a href="http://www.informz.net/z/cjUucD9taT02NzE5NTgmcD0xJnU9MTAxNjU3MzY1JmxpPTI2MTI4Nzk/index.html">Breakpoint</a>.<br /><br />I remember growing up during the height of the cold war, and not being too concerned about the Russians bombing the US with nukes.  I figured if there was so much devastation that the human race is nearly wiped out, a lot more is going on than some crazy politicians pushing big red buttons.  Read Revelation 9:15-19.<br /><br />I mean, really, <span style="font-style: italic;">dying</span> in a nuclear holocaust is not so bad if you trust in the sovereign Lord of the Universe.  The problem is <span style="font-style: italic;">surviving</span> one.
