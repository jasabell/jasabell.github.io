One of my pastors visited a couple in the hospital this last weekend whose adult son had been involved in a heavy equipment accident.  Apparently a hydraulic hose broke and sprayed the man with hydraulic fluid that promptly caught fire, burning over 80% of his body.  A co-worker pulled him from the flaming cab.  His 15-year old daughter watched the entire incident and heard her father's screams of agony as his skin burned.<br /><br />The pain is so intense, that the doctors have put him in an induced coma.  His parents, who are believers, have temporarily moved from another state so that they can be near their son.<br /><br />Recent surgery cut off the skin from his chest and grafted on skin from a cadaver.  The prayer is that it will graft in an not get infected.<br /><br />If you have read this far, I pray that you feel two things: 1) sorrow and pain for this man and his family that leads you to intercede for him in weeping prayer; and 2) a dawning recognition that if this kind of pain and suffering can happen on earth, how much more will the terror and anguish be in hell for those who do not repent?<br /><br />Matt. 13:41 The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, 42 and throw them into the fiery furnace. <span style="font-style: italic;">In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> 43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.
