From Rob Neyer:<br /><blockquote><i>youneverknow</i></blockquote><blockquote>What single word could better summarize what <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/milwaukee-brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a> catcher <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/31324/george-kottaras">George Kottaras</a> did, Saturday night in Houston?</blockquote><blockquote>Kottaras, the Brewers’ backup (and rarely used) catcher, entered the contest with 13 home runs and one triple in 454 career plate appearances.</blockquote><blockquote>In the second inning, Kottaras flied out. (Yawn.)</blockquote><blockquote>In the fourth inning, Kottaras hit a solo home run, a line drive that carried into the first row of right-field seats. (Well played, sir.)</blockquote><blockquote>In the sixth inning, Kottaras led off with a triple over the center fielder’s head and to the far reaches of <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9c/TalsHill.jpg">Tal’s Hill</a>. (Wait, what?)</blockquote><blockquote>In the seventh inning, Kottaras singled to right field. (Uh, guys? You might want to watch this...)&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>In the ninth inning, Kottaras drove another ball past the center fielder ... and this one bounced over the wall for an automatic double. (Say what?)&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Kottaras thus became the first major leaguer with a cycle this season, as the last to accomplish the feat was Colorado’s <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/31379/carlos-gonzalez">Carlos Gonzalez</a> more than 13 months ago. And Kottaras now has hit for the cycle more often (1) than every San Diego Padre (0) and Florida Marlin (0) in major-league history.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Of course, Kottaras probably isn’t the most unlikely cycler in history. He certainly isn’t the first slow catcher with just moderate power to hit for the cycle. If you’re making a list, though? Of the players who shocked the hell out of anyone paying attention? George Kottaras is within spitting distance of the top.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote><i>youneverknow</i></blockquote><a href="http://mlb.sbnation.com/2011/9/3/2403623/wait-who-hit-for-the-cycle-saturday-night">Read</a> the whole post and see a pic.<br /><br /><a href="http://mlb.sbnation.com/2011/9/4/2403872/george-kottaras-in-living-color">Watch</a> more.
