I remember my years in elementary school.  All that I longed to do was go outside and play.  Once I learned to ride a bike, we went all over the county (literally) and caught frogs and snakes and generally had a great time from sunup to sundown.<br /><br />My kids, however, would rather stay inside and play.  We guard the TV and greatly minimize viewing times.  But while kids play Barbies or Star Wars or Legos, we can't seem to get them outside.<br /><br />Read <a href="http://theresurgence.com/jerram_barrs_2003_everything_is_interesting">this article by Jerram Barrs</a> with me and help me see what we can do...<br /><br />(HT: <a href="http://theologica.blogspot.com/">Between Two Worlds</a>)
