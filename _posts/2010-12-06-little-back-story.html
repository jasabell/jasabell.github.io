<div>As I continue with my posts on literature and Harry Potter, I think it helpful to give a bit of back-story. I have been reading fiction my entire life, beginning with my mother and father who read to me faithfully, as well as my sixth grade teacher who read to our class every day, and this reading endeared him to me deeply.</div><div><br /></div><div>I read the Chronicles of Narnia in third grade, and the rest was <a href="http://theabellsix.blogspot.com/2009/08/greatest-story.html">history</a>, so to speak; I read a ton of sci-fi / fantasy in high school. I was immersed in all things fanciful. Looking back on my life, it seems my favorite stories have almost always been fantasy (not a bad thing, read <a href="http://brainstorm-services.com/wcu-2004/fairystories-tolkien.html">this</a>). Furthermore, I love the hero. Whether the hero was a cowboy, a swordsman, or a spy, I love the guy who saves the day and gets the girl.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, for me to sit in my van and shake my head knowingly as Lonnie Melashenko from <i>Voice of Prophecy</i> criticized J. K. Rowling for her work on the Harry Potter series was overtly hypocritical.</div><div><br /></div><div>It gets worse, not only did I read a ton of fiction without discernment, but by this time I had not yet completed <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Not that I hadn’t tried of course, for I had picked up<i> The Fellowship of the Ring</i> two or three times and only gotten fifty or so pages in before becoming bored. The escapist fiction that I had been saturated in was simpler, easier, and seemingly more exciting.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, of course, I know better. I have read through <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> multiple times and have found it deeper, wiser, and more emotionally compelling with each reading. The point I am trying to make is that my understanding of literature and story was very immature back in 1998. It was infantile, which made my unthinking agreement with the radio broadcaster that much worse.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, not only did I frown on Harry Potter, but I was hypocritical about it as well….</div>
