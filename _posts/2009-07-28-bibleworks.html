Since I began formal theological studies in 2004, I have been using <a href="http://www.bibleworks.com/">BibleWorks</a> as my preferred Bible software. I have often argued for this software over <a href="http://www.accordancebible.com/">Accordance</a> and <a href="http://www.logos.com/">Logos</a>. My main arguments are that BibleWorks is faster and cheaper and provides more bang for the buck than either of the other two contenders. The only downside is that BibleWorks does not run natively on a Mac; instead, one has to use Parallels or VMWare Fusion.<br /><br /><a href="http://theologica.blogspot.com/">Justin Taylor</a> linked to two reviews by Keith Mathison, one on <a href="http://www.ligonier.org/blog/2009/07/bibleworks-8---a-review.html">BibleWorks</a> and one on <a href="http://www.ligonier.org/blog/2009/07/accordance-8-review.html">Accordance</a>. It seems that Keith and I have the same understanding about these software bundles.
