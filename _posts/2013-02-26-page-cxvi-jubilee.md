From the <a href="http://www.pagecxvi.com/">Page CXVI</a> and <a href="http://www.theautumnfilm.com/">Autumn Film</a> announcement:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">To celebrate 7 years of making music together, the members of Page CXVI and The Autumn Film are giving away their entire music catalog for 7 weeks. Between re-arranging the classic hymns, to creating beautiful emotive indie pop music, the band has recorded 11 albums together. Please join them in celebrating this jubilee by catching up on the records youâ€™ve missed or download the entire catalog.</blockquote><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://pagecxvi.com/jubilee"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9r5guM21ZMs/US0IX92L0gI/AAAAAAAAAP4/_7aPi1yD2l0/s400/PAGE-CXVI-HYMNS-Jubilee-COVER.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />Note: the link associated with the image won't be live until Friday, March 1.
