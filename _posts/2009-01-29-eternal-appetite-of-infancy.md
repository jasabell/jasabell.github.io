A good friend of mine has a blog. You might want to <a href="http://www.remanations.com">check it out</a>. Yesterday, he placed a quote from Chesterton that I think is worth repeating and thinking about.<br /><blockquote>It is possible that God says every morning, “Do it again” to the sun; and every evening “Do it again” to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them. It may be that He has the eternal appetite of infancy; for we have sinned and grown old, and our Father is younger than we.<br />–G.K. Chesterton, Orthodoxy (p. 51)</blockquote>(HT: <a href="http://www.remanations.com">Remanations</a>)
