It is the day after Christmas and all through the malls, people are taking back the stuff they asked for and don't want now...<br /><br />Oh, if we stop and think carefully, we will realize how silly much of what goes on in the materialistic United States is.  How will God look at this nation?  How will history look back at us?  We are entirely rich, and entirely self-consumed.<br /><br />Those who are theologically minded are pretty self-consumed, as well.  Therefore, it seems appropriate that we should poke some fun at ourselves.  If you know what the emergent church is, or dispensationalism, or hyper-Calvinism, click on these links and laugh out loud.  If you can't laugh, you are too self-absorbed.<br /><br /><a href="http://purgatorio1.blogspot.com/2005/11/you-might-be-emerging-if.html">You might be emerging if...</a><br /><br /><a href="http://purgatorio1.blogspot.com/2005/12/you-know-youve-attained.html">You Know You've Attained Dispensationalist Divine Status When...</a><br /><br /><a href="http://purgatorio1.blogspot.com/2005/12/help-im-going-hyper.html">Help I'm going hyper...</a>
