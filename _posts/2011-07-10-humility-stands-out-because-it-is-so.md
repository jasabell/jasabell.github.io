I was happy to see Derek Jeter gain his 3,000th hit with a home run. I have always appreciated his clutch skill when watching him during the playoffs against my favorite teams. It seems that the Yankees always did my Mariners in during the first round years ago, and now do the same thing to the Twins. Jeter always got his hits in the clutch.<br /><br />The following paragraphs are what stood out to me when reading the article about his success. O for more outward actions like this...<br /><br /><blockquote>But even more impressive, to me anyway, was the way Jeter reacted to it. Surely, he knew as soon as he made contact that the 3,000th hit was finally his. Quite possibly he knew it was leaving the ballpark, his first home run over the fence at this stadium in more than a year.</blockquote><blockquote>But there was no bat-flipping, no jumping up and down, no Cadillac-ing around the bases. Jeter left the batterâ€™s box as if he had dribbled one down the third-base line and needed to run like hell to beat it out. And when it was obvious that no one was catching this one, he settled into a respectful trot. He did not leap onto home plate, or pump a fist, or do anything to embarrass the opposing pitcher or himself. He simply continued running into the embrace of the first of 24 teammates rushing out to meet him at home, who happened to be Jorge Posada, perhaps his closest friend on the team.</blockquote>Read the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/columns/story?columnist=matthews_wallace&amp;id=6753001">whole thing</a>.
