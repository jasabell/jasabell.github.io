The title of this post is a direct rip-off of Rich Mullins' song, "The Maker of Noses." You can google it to see the fantastic words.<br /><br />I have been in a meeting all morning and my mind has drifted from the tasks at hand to looking at the noses of people sitting around me.<br /><br />When you start looking at a person's nose by itself, as an appendage to a face, there seems to be only one conclusion.<br /><br />Noses are weird.<br /><br />What does this tell us about the <span style="font-style: italic;">Maker</span> of noses? He has a sense of humor, he is pleased with his creation, we should be thankful for the ability to smell bread. What else?
