C.H. Spurgeon writes <span style="font-size:85%;">(<span style="font-style: italic;">Lectures to My Students</span>, Zondervan, 331)</span>:<br /><blockquote>Have you not by this time discovered that flattery is as injurious as it is pleasant?  It softens the mind and makes you more sensitive to slander.  In proportion as praise pleases you censure will pain you.  Besides, it is a crime to be taken off from your great object of glorifying the Lord Jesus by petty consideration as to your little self, and, if there were no other reason, this ought to weigh much with you.  Pride is a deadly sin, and will grow without your borrowing the parish watercart to quicken it.  Forget expressions which feed your vanity, and if you mind yourself relishing the unwholesome morsels confess the sin with deep humiliation.  Payson showed that he was strong in the Lord when he wrote to his mother, “You must not, certainly, my dear mother, say one word which even looks like an intimation that you think me advancing in grace.  I cannot bear it.  All the people here, whether friends or enemies, conspire to ruin me.  Satan and my own heart, of course, will lend a hand; and if you join too, I fear all the cold water which Christ can throw upon my pride will not prevent its breaking out into a destructive flame.  As certainly as anybody flatters and caresses me my heavenly Father has to whip me: and an unspeakable mercy it is that he condescends to do it.  I can, it is true, easily muster a hundred reasons why I should not be proud, but pride will not mind reason, nor anything else but a good drubbing.  Even at this moment I feel it tingling in my fingers’ ends, and seeking to guide my pen.”  Knowing something myself of those secret whippings which our good Father administers to his servant when he sees them unduly exalted, I heartily add my own solemn warnings against your pampering the flesh by listening to the praises of the kindest friends you have.  They are injudicious, and you must beware of them.<br /></blockquote>
