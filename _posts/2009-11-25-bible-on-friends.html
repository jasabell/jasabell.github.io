A friend speaks face-to-face. (Exo 33:11)<br />A close friend can be described as one “who is as your own soul.” (Deut 13:6)<br />A friend is expected to be loyal. (2 Sam 16:17)<br />A friend is expected to be loyal. (2 Chr 20:7)<br />Withholding kindness from a friend is as forsaking the fear of the Lord. (Job 6:14)<br />Bargaining over your friend is a bad thing. (Job 6:27)<br />Grieving for a friend is like lamenting one’s mother. (Psa 35:14)<br />A close friend is trusted, one who you eat bread with. (Psa 41:9)<br />A friend loves at all times. (Prov 17:17)<br />A friend sticks closer than a brother. (Prov 18:24)<br />Faithful are the wounds of a friend. (Prov 27:6)<br />A friend gives earnest counsel. (Prov 27:9)<br />A friend is not to be forsaken. (Prov 27:10)<br />A friend is the opposite of an enemy. (James 4:4)
