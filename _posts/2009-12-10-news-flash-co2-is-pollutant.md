Okay, so I am going to copy Doug Wilson's post in its entirety, mainly because I laughed out loud.<br /><blockquote>The EPA, under the adroit leadership of Saruman, has now declared CO2 to be a pollutant. As the Staples Singers taught us so many years ago -- "put your hand on your mouth when you cough, that'll help the solution." And after these Hilaritards have regulated all us CO2 emitters into the ground, they will then turn their attentive ministrations to the real environmental challenge of the century, which is that of battling the plague of salt water.<br /><br />I just want everybody to stare straight at this for about 120 seconds without blinking. The Greens have successfully won their battle to categorize as a pollutant that element which makes plants grow lush and green. Heh. This would be really funny if it weren't so hilarious.</blockquote>You can read the whole thing <a href="http://www.dougwils.com/index.asp?Action=Anchor&amp;CategoryID=1&amp;BlogID=7201">here</a>, but then again, you just did.
