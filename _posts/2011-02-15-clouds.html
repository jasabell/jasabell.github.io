Not just because I think she takes great pictures, but because she is great. I am so thankful for her.<br /><br /><b>Update</b>: Actually, I just learned that my oldest daughter took this picture. This fact, of course, doesn't change anything of what I wrote above. I do think my wife is both a wonderful photographer and great. I also think my daughter is a wonderful photographer and great.
