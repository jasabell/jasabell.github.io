I am very thankful that the Bible does not sugarcoat anything. Even the greatest of prophets hated their life and the work to which they were called. Just before Jeremiah poured out the following cry he described how hard it was to be a prophet. He did not want to declare the coming destruction of Jerusalem, but when he tried to be quiet and keep his mouth shut, his bones burned within him. He <i>had</i> to declare the horrible prophesies. In pure, honest, heartbreak he cries out:<br /><br />14 &nbsp; <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Cursed be the day<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">  </span>on which I was born!<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span> The day when my mother bore me,<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">  </span>let it not be blessed!<br />15 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father,<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span> “A son is born to you,”<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">  </span>making him very glad.<br />16 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Let that man be like the cities<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">  </span>that the LORD overthrew without pity;<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span> let him hear a cry in the morning<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">  </span>and an alarm at noon,<br />17 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>because he did not kill me in the womb;<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">  </span>so my mother would have been my grave,<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">  </span>and her womb forever great.<br />18 <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Why did I come out from the womb<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">  </span>to see toil and sorrow,<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">  </span>and spend my days in shame?<br /><br />—Jeremiah 20:14–18 (ESV)
