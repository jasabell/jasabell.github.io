For as far back as my early college years I have always had a strange notion that when I get to heaven I would be able to ask strange statistical questions <i>and</i>&nbsp;get answers. For instance, at precisely 7:36pm, Friday, May 27, how many people in the world are sleeping? How many are eating? How many are eating salmon? How many leaves are blowing in the wind? Of course, these are totally inconsequential statistics, but God knows the answers. I mean, he knows how many hairs are on my head, and has to adjust his tally every time one falls out or a new one grows.&nbsp;Why not strange statistics?&nbsp;Wouldn't it be cool to know how many people actually enjoyed <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>?<div><br /></div><div>In today's world, with more powerful computers and a lot more people thinking about how to display information, we could expand my strange fascination by taking my question through time. How many people actually enjoyed&nbsp;<i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>&nbsp;over time? Can I see an infographic showing the total worldwide population of people who enjoyed that book since it was published to the present day?</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, provide a graph comparing this number, over time, to the number of people who disliked it.</div>
