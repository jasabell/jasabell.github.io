<a href="http://windowssecrets.com/comp/090514/">Windows Secrets</a>, a popular online newsletter for Windows users, had the following lead-in to their top story, written by Woody Leonhard:<br /><blockquote>If you've ever wondered why it's so difficult to manage and share files in Windows, you'll be delighted with two significant new features in Windows 7.<br /><br />These new capabilities, called Libraries and Homegroups, make finding files and connecting with resources on other PCs so easy you'll think you're using a Mac!</blockquote>Hah! Why not just use a Mac and avoid all the MS hassle?
