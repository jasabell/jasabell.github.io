My godly bride took up running two years ago. I have been chasing her around the house for over twenty years; now I have to actually get outside to try and catch her!<br /><br />She ran her first 10k race this last Saturday. I am so proud of all her hard work. She finished in the top 32 percent in her age bracket. Donâ€™t let that fool you. She also finished in the top 32 percent of women 10 years younger. She rocks.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FrkFsKPNfVw/TcA50Lal6zI/AAAAAAAAALg/9vTiXYSBmYg/s1600/First10k.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FrkFsKPNfVw/TcA50Lal6zI/AAAAAAAAALg/9vTiXYSBmYg/s320/First10k.jpg" width="240" /></a></div><br /><br />You can check out the wear and tear on her shoes over the last two years <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theabellsix/5632060618/">here</a>.<br /><br />I love you, my bride. Way to go!
