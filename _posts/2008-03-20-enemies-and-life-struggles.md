After I finished thinking about God hearing us, I thought about other things in the Bible that could be comparable.  Specifically I thought about how David wrote Psalms about getting relief from his enemies.  If stars (see previous entry) can be compared to people, then certainly enemies can be compared to various life struggles and battles.  In other words, the stress of getting a project at work completed is no less mundane than protection for enemies seeking our life.  Not that enemies are mundane, but David’s work week and our work week are similar in that we both trudge off to do battle with something.<br /><br />Then I read Psalm 55 in my quiet time after I got to work.  “Give ear to my prayer, O God, and hide not yourself from my plea for mercy!  Attend to me, and answer me; I am restless in my complaint and I moan, because of the noise of my enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked.  For they drop trouble upon me, an din anger they bear a grudge against me” (Ps 55:1-3).<br /><br />We can bring our mundane troubles with curriculum or networks or people or studies to God in the same way as David cried out to God about his enemies.  This is really basic, but this morning it seemed very profound to me.
