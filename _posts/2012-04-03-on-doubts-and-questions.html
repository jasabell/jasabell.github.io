From <a href="http://www.dougwils.com/">Douglas Wilson</a>:<br /><br />“The point is that questions, even tough questions, can be answered. And when they are answered, the questioner grows in his knowledge and understanding. Don’t worry whether the Bible can stand up to your questions. It is an anvil that has worn out many hammers.”<br /><br />Read the <a href="http://www.dougwils.com/Previous-Publications/the-difference-between-doubts-and-questions.html">whole post</a>.
