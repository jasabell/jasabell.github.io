Jonathan Edwards writes <span style="font-size:85%;">(</span><span style="font-style: italic;font-size:85%;" >Religious Affections</span><span style="font-size:85%;">, Yale, 312-314)</span>:<br /><blockquote>The essence of evangelical humiliation consists in such humility, as becomes a creature, in itself exceeding sinful, under a dispensation of grace; consisting in a mean esteem of himself, as in himself nothing, and altogether contemptible and odious; attended with a mortification of a disposition to exalt himself, and a free renunciation of his own glory.<br /><br />This is a great and most essential thing in true religion.  The whole frame of the gospel, and everything appertaining to the new Covenant, and all God’s dispensations towards fallen man, are calculated to bring to pass this effect in the hearts of men.  They that are destitute of this, have no true religion, whatever profession they make, and how high soever their religious affections may be; “Behold, his soul which is lifted up, is not upright in him; but the just shall life by his faith”  (Hab. 2:4): i.e. he shall live by his faith on God’s righteousness and grace, and not his own goodness and excellency.<br /></blockquote>
