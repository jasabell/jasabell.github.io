Someone recently learned that I celebrated my 40th birthday in 2010 and asked if we had a big shindig. Yes, we did. Because I don’t like birthdays, nor do I like—for some irrational reason—having others celebrate my birthday, I thought it wisest to take things into my own hands and plan and orchestrate my own 40th birthday party.<br /><br />It is not necessary to share a lot of details; however, because of my joy of grilling, I thought I would share the menu. I borrowed a buddy’s Weber, and used his and mine at the same time to cook all the main dishes. I spent the day before preparing and cooking dessert, and spent the big day grilling (oh, and I ran a half marathon in the morning). It was a blast and kept me busy enough not to think about the shindig being anything other than a get together of friends.<br /><br />Of course, Wendy was my lovely assistant and was just as important to the cooking process as anyone else. I am a blessed man, indeed.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_p0aKmLIk4oY/TRQKshCAdpI/AAAAAAAAAIs/GEzzbl3ELc0/s1600/40th+B-day+Menu.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_p0aKmLIk4oY/TRQKshCAdpI/AAAAAAAAAIs/GEzzbl3ELc0/s320/40th+B-day+Menu.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br /><b>Appetizers</b><br />Wendy's homemade bruschetta<br />Barbecued teriyaki chicken wings<br />Mission tortilla strips with homemade fresh tomato salsa<br /><br /><b>Main Course</b><br />Barbecue hot dogs<br />Barbecue Hamburgers (with <a href="http://theabellsix.blogspot.com/2010/12/layered-spices.html">rub</a>)<br />Barbecue Pizza (Homemade crust with Asiago, Parmesan, and Mozzarella cheeses)<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2~Pepperoni<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2~Meat (pepperoni, canadian bacon, sausage)<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2~BLT<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2~Barbecue chicken and red onions<br />Barbecue Baja Burritos<br /><br /><b>Dessert</b><br />Jello Oreo Dessert ($3.29)<br />Betty Crocker Yellow Cake with Chocolate Frosting ($2.85)<br />Jason's Homemade Silky Smooth Cheesecake with Fresh Peaches and Raspberries (Priceless)<br /><br /><b>Beverages</b><br />Water<br />Juice<br />Sweet Tea<br />Coke<br />Beer (international hand-picked choices from a connoisseur)
