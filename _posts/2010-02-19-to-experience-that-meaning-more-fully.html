“A story is a way to say something that can’t be said any other way, and it takes every word in the story to say what the meaning is. You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate. When anybody asks what a story is about, the only proper thing is to tell him to read the story. The meaning of fiction is not abstract meaning but experience meaning, the purpose of making statements about the meaning of a story is only to help you to experience that meaning more fully.”<br /><br />(Flannery O’Connor, <span style="font-style: italic;">Mystery and Manners</span>, p. 96)<br /><br />HT: <a href="http://www.harvardichthus.org/author/nicknowalk/">Nick Nowalk</a>
