Hello! My name is Jason Abell, and this is the new blog for the Abell clan that is currently located in Minnesota. We want this blog to be a place where our family and friends can see what is happening in our lives and interact with us.

We don't know whether this will work or not. We don't know whether we will keep it up, or whether anyone will even look at it. But, we are going to give it a try.

We will try to post pictures and blips of information about our family and the happenings of life.

Thank you for visiting!
