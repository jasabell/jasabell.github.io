There are some big decisions going on in our lives right now: what job should we move towards (there are several options), should we visit Kentucky in April, what will our future be, am I called to teach in a college or preach in a church or how do I do both, and can I get Wendy a new camera?  Some of these are big, and some are small, but all of them feel weighty when we are trying to live for the Lord and be holy with our lives.  TBI needs about $2M in the next month or so to construct out the building we have been given and launch a bigger vision.  That is big.  Is it inappropriate to ask the Lord to be quick with his decisions?<br /><br />Psalm 70 speaks to this.  Verse 1 says, “Make haste, O God, to deliver me!  O Lord, make haste to help me!"  Now, one might argue that David is speaking about deliverance from his enemies.  That is true, yet do we not all have enemies of one form or another?  (See comments in the last post.)  What was the biggest difficulty in David’s life that he cried out to God about?  It was his enemies.  David cried out about his front burner issues, and I think that we should also cry out to God about our front burner issues.  Just because we are not being sought by enemies “who desire our hurt” (Ps 70:2), does not mean that we can not cry out to God about our financial woes, our career woes, our family woes.  We can and should cry out to God in all these things.<br /><br />And, if we take David as our example, we can also beg God to be quick about it.  It is not necessarily disrespectful to God to ask him to hurry, as long as our heart is not angry or presumptuous.  Instead, like David, we should be poor and needy.  David wrote, “But I am poor and needy; hasten to me, O God!  You are my help and my deliverer; O Lord, do not delay! (Ps 70:5).
