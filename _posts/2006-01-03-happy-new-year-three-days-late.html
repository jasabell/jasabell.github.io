Happy New Year!  We wish you all a wonderful new year.  May God bless you as you strive to find your joy in Him.  For, as my pastor says, "God is most glorified in us, when we are most satisfied in Him."  So, find your satisfaction in Christ, and in doing so, you will fulfill your greatest duty to glorify him.<br /><br />We are a little disappointed in the weather.  It is supposed to be cold here in Minnesota, but it hasn't hardly dipped below 32 degrees for the last few weeks.  The lakes are starting to thaw.  Several trucks have fallen through the ice on one lake.  If we have to put up with heat and humidity in the summer, I sure would like to have a worthy winter.<br /><br />School starts again this coming Monday.  However, I have two assignments, plus reading due on that day, so I have started studying again.  Please pray for Wendy and I as we try to get back into the swing of TBI and homeschool.<br /><br />May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope (Romans 15:13).
