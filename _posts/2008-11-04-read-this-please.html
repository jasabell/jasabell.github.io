My kids, who don't get to watch TV much, have still gleaned enough about the national election to be worried.  It is not right if kids are worried about the state of our nation, although it is good for them to be aware.  My response to them is to remember that God is still on his throne and Jesus is still Lord over all.<br /><br />Whether you like Douglas Wilson or not, <a href="http://www.dougwils.com/index.asp?Action=Anchor&amp;CategoryID=1&amp;BlogID=6017">his post from this morning</a> is well worth reading.  Please read it, and don't forget that as Christians, we don't trust in horses or chariots or republicans or democrats.  We trust in the Lord.<br /><br />Here are some highlights from his post:<br /><blockquote>1. God is still Father, Christ is still at His right hand, and the Holy Spirit is still abroad in the world, recreating that world according to the image of Christ. When the nations conspire against Him, He laughs at them.<br /><br />4. Honor women. Honor your mother, your wife, and your daughters. We live in a culture that despises women, and which has engineered a vast machinery of propaganda designed to get them to surrender to it. If you don't know how to honor, on a day-to-day basis, the women in your life, then learn. Make it a priority.<br /><br />7. Learn something about economics. <span style="font-style: italic;">Please</span>.<br /><br />10. Fight in the culture wars as those who gladly serve the triune God of heaven. We are not dogs fighting over a piece of meat, and we must never allow the surly or shrill attitudes of the self-righteous to creep into anything we do. We must be puritan cavaliers, and merry warriors. Fight like a regenerate D'Artanian, and not like a thug with a Bible he stole from the motel, or like a prim and censorious Miss Grundy, she of the pursed lips. We are <span style="font-style: italic;">Christians</span>, not wowsers.<br /></blockquote>Read the <a href="http://www.dougwils.com/index.asp?Action=Anchor&amp;CategoryID=1&amp;BlogID=6017">whole thing</a>.
