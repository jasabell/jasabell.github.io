Click below to listen to a recent lesson I taught on John 10:1-21.  There has been a lot of problems with audio lately, as the first ten minutes of this teaching did not get recorded.  The audio picks up ten minutes in, after a review of John 9:1-5, at 9:6.<br /><br /><a href="http://jasabell.home.comcast.net/downloads/Teaching%2C%20Part%202%2C%20John%2010_1-21%201.mp3">Would We Recognize a Good Shepherd if We Saw One?</a>
