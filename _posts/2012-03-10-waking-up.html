Why is waking up so hard to do,<br />When the day is work and not play,<br />And the bed is warm and<br />The room is cold?<br />Why is the alarm hard to hear<br />And the sleep so deep?<br />But on Saturday, O for shame!<br />My eyes open and thoughts begin<br />It’s too early, why can’t I sleep in?<br /><br />—Anonymous
