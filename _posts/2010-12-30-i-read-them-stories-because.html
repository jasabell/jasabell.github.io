A former classmate, <a href="http://www.harvardichthus.org/author/nicknowalk/">Nick Nowalk</a>, wrote this <a href="http://www.harvardichthus.org/fishtank/2010/12/why-i-read-fantastical-stories-full-of-make-believe-to-my-kids/">post</a>, which has much to do with all that I have been writing and thinking lately. The post is titled, “Why I Read Fantastical Stories Full of Make-Believe To My Kids.” Here is an excerpt...<br /><blockquote>Most of all, I read them stories because I desperately desire—insofar as it depends on me—to shape their consciousness and baptize their imagination with categories, experiences, and longings that will one day respond to the Gospel with the cry: “Yes! Of course this is what it was always about. What else could possibly account for the way things are in this world?” I want to ruin them early for cheap, disconnected sex and trivial ambitions (when they are ultimate) like going to Harvard, making millions, or becoming the president. I want to expand their souls and make them impossible to satisfy or stuff with creation alone. And I aim to to do all this damage because I want Jesus Christ crucified and risen to have the compelling ring of truth when they begin to think and choose for themselves as they leave home to find their own place in the Story. Every moment I spend reading aloud to them is subordinated to the hope that Jesus would be recognized as the ultimate source and inspiration of every late night chill, tear, laugh or inconsolable yearning as my fiction stories ring true once more in their bedroom. Because I want them to understand that all of the gallant virtues they have come to admire and love through these stories are summed up in the daily act of taking up their cross to follow this Jesus into a kingdom that will triumph over all evil and sadness, and which will reign forever and ever and ever in the happy ending to end all happy endings.</blockquote>Nick was light years ahead of me in class. He is an excellent writer and thinker. I thank God for giving men like Nick the mind and ability that he has.
