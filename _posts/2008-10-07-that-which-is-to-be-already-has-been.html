I realize that there is a lot more going on in Ecclesiastes than meets the eye.  Is there one writer or two?  Is it Solomon or not?<br /><br />Yet, there are nuggets of truth in Ecclesiastes that are beyond profound and require serious thought.  So many of the arguments of our day wrestle around the doctrine of God's sovereignty.  I have believed in God's absolute sovereignty for years now, and while I still wrestle with the ramifications of that belief, I find it very comforting.<br /><br />Here is a nugget from Ecclesiastes that is worth our time pondering:<br /><br />Ecclesiastes 3:14-15:  I perceived that whatever God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. God has done it, so that people fear before him. 15 That which is, already has been; that which is to be, already has been; and God seeks what has been driven away.
