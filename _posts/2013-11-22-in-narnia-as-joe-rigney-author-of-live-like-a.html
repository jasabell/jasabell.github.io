<blockquote>In Narnia, as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bethlehemcollegeandseminary.org/index.php/academics/faculty/joseph-rigney">Joe Rigney</a>, author of “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Live-Like-Narnian-Discipleship-Chronicles/dp/0615872042/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385135193&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=live+like+a+narnian+christian+discipleship+in+lewis%27s+chronicles">Live Like a Narnian</a>,” told me on “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.breakpoint.org/features-columns/discourse/entry/15/23913">BreakPoint This Week</a>,” Lewis has created a complete and total world that helps us live better in this world. You can visit Narnia, and when you come back, Rigney told me, “You’re different. You’re not the same person, because you swam Narnian seas, and you walked across a Narnian countryside, and you’ve had Narnian adventures. And because of that, you are more like a Narnian  &hellip; meaning you live more like Jesus.”</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://www.breakpoint.org/bpcommentaries/breakpoint-commentaries-archive/entry/13/23897">John Stonestreet</a> Joe Rigney is a very dear friend. His book is highly recommended.
