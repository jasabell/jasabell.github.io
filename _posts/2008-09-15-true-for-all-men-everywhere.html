The first point that we must make is that it is impossible even to begin living the Christian life, or to know anything of true spirituality, before one is a Christian.  And the only way to become a Christian is neither by trying to live some sort of a Christian life nor by hoping for some sort of religious experience, but rather by accepting Christ as Savior.  No matter how complicated, educated, or sophisticated we may be, or how simple we may be, we must all come the same way, insofar as becoming a Christian is concerned.  As the kings of the earth and the mighty of the earth are born in exactly the same way, physically, as the simplest man, so the most intellectual person must become a Christian in exactly the same way as the simplest person.  This is true for all men everywhere, through all space and all time.  There are no exceptions.  Jesus said a totally exclusive word: "No man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6).<br /><br />Francis Schaeffer, <span style="font-style:italic;">True Spirituality</span>, p. 3.
