The issue of hymns in the church can be a strained one, but I find myself loving these hymns with words that are theologically sound and a music style that appeals to where I am at. Very selfish, I know.<br /><br />The first Hymns album fit that bill nicely. Even my kids (9–14) enjoy the album, so much so that one of my daughters wants the Page CXVI version of <span style="font-style: italic;">Nothing But The Blood</span> played at her funeral. Morbid, yes, but not unworthy of thanksgiving.<br /><br />For one week only, starting today, you can download the first Hymns album for free. Visit <a href="http://www.pagecxvi.com/share">here</a>.<br /><br />The new album contains the following songs:<br /><br />1. How Great Thou Art<br /><br />2. Praise To The Lord<br /><br />3. Jesus I Am Resting, Resting<br /><br />4. Rock Of Ages<br /><br />5. Abide With Me<br /><br />6. Battle Hymn Of The Republic<br /><br />7. Doxology<br /><br />You can order/download the new album <a href="http://www.pagecxvi.com/">here</a>.
