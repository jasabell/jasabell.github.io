I have written before about <a href="http://theabellsix.blogspot.com/2007/06/schreiner-on-galatians.html">Tom Schreiner</a> being one of my heroes. It is good to have heroes. It is also good when they are mild-mannered scholars.<br /><br />I have not written about the fact that every good preaching pastor should have serious, rigorous, pastoral, commentaries on their shelf that they see as their “go-to” commentary.<br /><br />It is really cool when my hero writes such a commentary. In fact, he has written three on deep, rich, and difficult Bible books (at this level, they are all difficult). Schreiner’s commentary on <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/bcsbookstore-20/detail/0801021499">Romans</a> was the first commentary I ever bought—a story I love to tell about God’s providence in my life.<br /><br />Recently, a good friend gave me the <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/bcsbookstore-20/detail/0310243726">Galatians</a> commentary as a gift. It holds the pride of place among my Galatians commentaries.<br /><br />Guy Waters over at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reformation21.org/shelf-life/review-galatians-zondervan-exegetical-commentary-on-the-nt.php">Reformation21</a> just reviewed Schreiner’s work. Here is his conclusion:<br /><blockquote>As one who annually teaches at the seminary level a course in the exegesis of the Greek text of Galatians, I have publicly lamented before my students the absence of a readable, recent, post-NPP, exegetically-rigorous, Reformationally-theological commentary on the Greek text of Galatians. Many of the theologically solid commentaries are older or do not engage the Greek text. Many of the exegetically rigorous commentaries, even the recent ones, give me theological pause. Finally, I can tell my students that if they ever preach or teach Paul’s epistle to the Galatians, then Schreiner’s Galatians needs to have a place on their study shelf. This work has the double benefit not only of yielding much exegetical fruit from the Epistle to the Galatians, but also of modeling what an exegetical commentary in the service of the church can and should be. And in this, our commentary-writing age, I hope that others take note.</blockquote>Please get this commentary as your “go-to” commentary on <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/bcsbookstore-20/detail/0310243726">Galatians</a>.
