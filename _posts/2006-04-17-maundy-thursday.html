It is amazing to me how quickly time flies.  I wanted to write about this last Thursday, and am just now getting to it.<br /><br />As part of the Easter season at Bethlehem Baptist, we have a service on the Thursday before Easter.  It is called the Maundy Thursday service.  Maundy Thursday is sometimes called Holy Thursday and is meant to commemorate the last supper of Jesus.<br /><br />Bethlehem makes the service very solemn and dark.  We have a fifteen foot wooden cross at the center of the stage area lit with somber lights.  Then two readers read the Passion story.  The readings are intermixed with hymns about Christ's death.<br /><br />After the reading and singing, a communion meditation is given and the congregation takes communion.  Finally, everyone leaves the sanctuary (and out to their cars) in complete silence with all the lights turned out.<br /><br />It is a deep way to commemorate the Last Supper and to begin to prepare for Easter Sunday.<br /><br />The Lord has risen!<br />The Lord has risen, indeed!
