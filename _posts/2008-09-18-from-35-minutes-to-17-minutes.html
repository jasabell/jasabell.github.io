Woohoo!  My commute just went from 35 minutes each way to 17 minutes each way.  The I-35W bridge is finished and I drove over it this morning!  I am sure that thousands of people drove over it before I did, including one Tom Steller, who drove over it when it opened at 5 AM.  Nuts!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_p0aKmLIk4oY/SNJmVVCXHDI/AAAAAAAAADk/q9kdSOoy1jI/s1600-h/bridge0919%2B2bridge.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_p0aKmLIk4oY/SNJmVVCXHDI/AAAAAAAAADk/q9kdSOoy1jI/s320/bridge0919%2B2bridge.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5247369032450382898" /></a><br /><br />Read <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/Blog/1398_the_opening_of_the_i35w_bridge/">Piper</a> on the bridge opening.
