I have seen it written (I just can't remember where - maybe <a href="http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/ten-reasons-i-dont-read-your-blog">here</a> or <a href="http://thinklings.org/?post_id=4463">here</a>) that posting quotes from books you are reading without providing your own commentary is bad blog etiquette.  However, from the numbers of comments this blog receives (the <a href="http://theabellsix.blogspot.com/2008/08/my-best-squirrel-story-ever.html">squirrel</a> story has more comments than the rest of the site put together) I don't think I am running too big of a risk.<br /><br />Why am I writing this?  See the next post.
