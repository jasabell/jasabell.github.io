Now that our family’s friendship with Harry Potter is public knowledge, I can begin to move into what I really want to write about. In previous posts, I wrote the story of how we came to enjoy the Potter books, but my real point in doing this was so I can work through questions that have been rattling around in my head.<br /><br />Having read the Potter series, faced my own prejudices, and met some similar prejudices in others, I have the following questions…<br /><br />1) &nbsp;Why do so many Christians have such a negative view of Harry Potter, and is this view justified?<br /><br />2) &nbsp;Why does the magic in Harry Potter pose a problem for Christians, or does it? Should it?<br /><br />3) &nbsp;Is it OK for Christians to read Harry Potter?<br /><br />4) &nbsp;More broadly, is it OK for Christians to read non-Christian fiction? In other words, is it OK for Christians to read anything but Christian theology and other related Christian-living books? If yes, then why do those of us who do often get sideways glances from other Christians?<br /><br />5) &nbsp;What exactly is literature, and could Harry Potter be considered literature?<br /><br />6) &nbsp;What is escapist fiction and can it be read, too?<br /><br />7) &nbsp;What other questions should I be asking and thinking through?
