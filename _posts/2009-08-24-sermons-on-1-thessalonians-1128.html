The gracious folks at <a href="http://www.oakridgecommunity.org/main/">Oakridge Community Church</a> in Stillwater, MN, invited me back to preach on two Sundays earlier this month. The two sermons are below. Right-click to download:<br /><ul><li>1 Thessalonians 1:1-10  <a href="http://jasabell.home.comcast.net/downloads/20090802GivingThankstoGodforYou.mp3">Giving Thanks to God for You</a>, August 2, 2009<br /></li><li>1 Thessalonians 2:1-8  <a href="http://jasabell.home.comcast.net/downloads/20090809BoldnesstoDeclaretheGospel.mp3">Boldness in God to Declare the Gospel</a>, August 9, 2009<br /></li></ul>It was a pure pleasure to exult over this text with an attentive congregation. I thank God for the opportunity.
