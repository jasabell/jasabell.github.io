I have been stressed at work lately, and this morning as I drove in I attempted to pray.  As I looked at the masses of people in cars around me, I wondered how could God possibly hear me.  Why would he hear me?  I am so small, so insignificant in relation to the rest of the world and all that is going on.  There are seven million people in the greater Twin Cities area.  There are six plus billion people in the world.  There are governments, presidents, ambassadors, rebels, and corporate CEOs.  How and why could or would he possibly listen to me as I drive in to work on I-35W in Minneapolis, MN?<br /><br />Then a text from Isaiah 40 came to mind.  "To whom then will you compare me, that I should be like him? says the Holy One.  Lift up your eyes on high and see: who created these [stars]?  He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name, by the greatness of his might, and because he is strong in power not one is missing" (Isa 40:25-26).<br /><br />There are hundreds of millions of galaxies in our universe and there are likely hundreds of millions of universes.  That means there are billions of stars.  Stars that all have a name.  Stars that all emit light in various ranges of the spectrum.  Stars that emit various radio and magnetic and electric and light waves that create a symphony to those that have ears to hear and eyes to see.  Who has those eyes to see and ears to hear?  Who knows them all by name?<br /><br />The God of the Bible.  And if he knows all those stars, who have names and are not missing, then I can be confident he hears my prayers.<br /><br />Father God, please strengthen my faith in you today.  Grant me eyes to see and ears to hear your wondrous works.  Amen.
