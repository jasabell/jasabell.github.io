I know nothing about Jared Weaver other than he is in a race for the Cy Young this year. Based on this article I am rooting for him to win.<br /><br />Rob Neyer reports:<br /><blockquote>Well, this is <a href="http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/mlb/story/_/id/6889644/jered-weaver-bucks-scott-boras-advice-new-los-angeles-angels-deal">certainly refreshing</a> (via <a href="http://ESPNLosAngeles.com/">ESPNLosAngeles.com</a>'s Mark Saxon):&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/6479/jered-weaver">Jered Weaver</a> admits he had to go against the advice of agent Scott Boras before agreeing to the <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels">Los Angeles Angels</a>' five-year, $85 million contract extension, but he said the lure of staying home outweighed the seduction of greater riches.<br />“If $85 (million) is not enough to take care of my family and other generations of families then I’m pretty stupid, but how much money do you really need in life?” Weaver said Tuesday. “I’ve never played this game for the money. I played it for the love and the competitive part of it. It just so happens that baseball’s going to be taking care of me for the rest of my life.”&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>--snip--&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>“How much more do you need?” Weaver asked about his deal. “Could have got more, whatever. Who cares?”</blockquote></blockquote>Read the whole <a href="http://mlb.sbnation.com/2011/8/24/2381620/jered-weaver-contract-scott-boras-angels-roster-news">thing</a>.
