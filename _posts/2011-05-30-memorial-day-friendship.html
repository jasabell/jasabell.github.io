We spent today, Memorial Day, with our dear friends, the <a href="http://thecrutchmers.wordpress.com/">Crutchmers</a>, who are longing to help provide theological education to pastors in Finland. We played soccer, barbecued, ate, laughed, and generally enjoyed a pleasant, if a tad too warm, day.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/jasabell/BloggerPictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCPbDl7-y8bq3Ug#5612721468012645762" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; display: inline !important; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8OxeZwdllgg/TeRkcAwaTYI/AAAAAAAAAME/rc_Wlnjj_IY/s320/IMG_0768.jpg" width="213" /></a><br /><br />We thanked the Lord Jesus Christ for his many blessing to us, including our freedom, earned for us by those who have fought and died so that we could enjoy a day like today. It was not lost on us, however, that our greatest freedom was gained through Jesusâ€™ birth by a virgin, his perfectly obedient life, his cursed death on our behalf, and his victorious resurrection.<br /><br />So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed (John 8:36).
