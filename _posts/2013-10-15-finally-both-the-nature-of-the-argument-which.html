<blockquote>Finally, both the nature of the argument (which brings in the presence of the Spirit in their lives as the clincher) and the emphasis on the &ldquo;presentness&rdquo; and &ldquo;indwelling&rdquo; nature of the Spirit as gift point to the Spirit as God&rsquo;s <em>effectual</em> empowerment in the struggle against sin. This does not mean that the Spirit guarantees perfection — hardly so — but it does mean that one is left without argument for helplessness. As Plummer (correctly) asserts: &ldquo;This [gifting of Spirit] transformed their whole life; and it put an end to the pagan plea that [people have] no power to resist impure desires&rdquo; (63). For Paul the presence of the Spirit was not simply God&rsquo;s gift as <em>an option</em> against sin; nor would he have understood the Spirit as present but ineffectively so. To the contrary, the dynamic that makes Paul&rsquo;s argument against sexual impurity possible is the experienced reality of the Spirit. Thus for Paul the Spirit is not only the key to becoming believers (1:6), but is the power for truly Christian behavior, and therefore makes disobedience on their part a difficult thing to argue for.</blockquote>&#8212;Fee, Gordon, <em>The First and Second Letters to the Thessalonians</em>, NICNT, p. 155. This is a phenomenal commentary. I love Gordon Fee. This paragraph is in conclusion to 1 Thessalonians 4:8, where Paul warns the Thessalonians about rejecting his teaching. If they reject his teaching, they reject not man, but God who gave them his Spirit.
