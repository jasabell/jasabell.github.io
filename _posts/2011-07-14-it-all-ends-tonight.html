w00t! We have tickets to the midnight show of <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>, Part 2 for tonight at 12:01am. &nbsp;Mackenzie, Chase, Kayleigh, <a href="http://preciseandtowering.tumblr.com/">Matt</a>, and I will all arrive early at Carmike Wynnsong in Mounds View for the fun and festivities. Well, actually, we just want to see the other fans in costume and watch the final installment of a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/2011/07/harry-potter-jesus-and-me/">great story</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;cultural phenomenon.<br /><br />I know the Cherokee Hills subdivision pool boy will be there. What about you? Stop by the biggest screen and say hi if you go.
