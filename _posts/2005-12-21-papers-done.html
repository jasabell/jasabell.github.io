I clicked send on the email last night at 11:57 pm. The paper was not late if emailed by 11:59 pm. Barring any internet glitch, it was turned in on time. I really am thankful to God for the ability and priviledge of writing that paper. It was a joy to dig so deeply into Hebrews 10:26-31. As soon as I can figure out a way to post a link to the paper on this site, I will do it.<br /><br />Thank you to all who have prayed for me. I have one more final tomorrow afternoon and then break for Christmas. It will be a wonderful time, I am sure.
