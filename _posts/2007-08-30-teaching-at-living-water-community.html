In February, 2007, Pastor Tom Steller and I had the opportunity to fly to my hometown of Vancouver, WA, and teach a weekend seminar on the Bible study method called "arcing."  The following two links are for audio from that session.  The first audio is where I taught through the arc for 1 Samuel 12:19-25.  I had recently preached on this same passage before a bunch of seminary students, and now had the opportunity to preach through it to a church congregation learning to study their Bibles.  I hope you can tell the difference between the two!  Click <a href="http://theabellsix.blogspot.com/2007/03/1-samuel-1219-25.html">here</a> to listen to the first sermon.<br /><br /><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~jasabell/04_1_Samuel_12_19-25_1.mp3">Arcing 1 Samuel 12:19-25</a><br /><br />This second audio is from the very last session of the weekend.  I was to close out the weekend by teaching through the arc of Romans 11:33-36.  It was a sober and wonderful moment.  Unfortunately, the last ten minutes of the audio were lost!  The whole weekend was supposed to have been videotaped and yet nothing turned out except for about seven hours of poor audio.  This is the very last twenty minutes.<br /><br /><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~jasabell/06_Romans_11_33-36_1.mp3">Arcing Romans 11:33-36</a><br /><br />This passage is so profound and deep; I wish my exposition of Paul's wonder at the depth and riches of God's wisdom and knowledge had survived technology!
