Yesterday was a great day.  It was one of those days where everything went right.  First off, Pastor Piper recently announced that he has been diagnosed with <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/news_events/dgm_news/2006/20060106_cancer_announcement.html">prostate cancer</a> and when he preached on Sunday morning, he discussed this in light of the the Christian life and the Word of God.  He was in great form and his preaching was superb.  Check www.desiringgod.org for this sermon.  I will provide a link as soon as it is posted.  While Pastor Piper's disease is not a good thing, the word that was preached was fantastic.  I wish you all could sit under this kind of teaching.<br /><br />After church, we went to McDonalds and then traded in last years ice skates for this years ice skates.  Play It Again Sports sells used skates, and we were able to trade in last years skates to offset the cost.  Then we went to the park a block from our house and skated for an hour or two.  All the while is was gently snowing.  It was a wonderful time.<br /><br />After the kids were in bed, Wendy and I finished reading the first section of a book on Pauline Theology.<br /><br />What a great day!<br /><br />You may think we are nuts, but such is life in Minnesota.
