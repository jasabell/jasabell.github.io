> That sanctification is a relationship with God that occurs in time. That means I experience forgiveness in time, and I experience that cleansing in time. I can experience that forgiveness after confessing while knowing the entire time that the one with whom I am in relationship does not have the same relationship to time that I do. In a sense, I was forgiven before I confessed. In that same sense, I was forgiven before I sinned. In that same sense, I was forgiven 2,000 years ago. But I still pray in time, learn about my motivations in time, put things right with brothers and sisters in time. And I do the same with my Father in Heaven. In other words, to put the whole thing very simply, the receipt of forgiveness is a blessing that sinners can receive in more than one way. If I seek to receive it for the sin I committed yesterday, this in no way constitutes forgetfulness that I have already received it in another.
