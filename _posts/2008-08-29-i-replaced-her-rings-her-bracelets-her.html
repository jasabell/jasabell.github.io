"I replaced her rings, her bracelets, her combs, before I closed the grave, and that was Lorraine.  All that she had ever been or wanted to be had come to this, and that is the whole story of how we met and how we parted, Lorraine and I, in the land called Lorraine, and it is like onto my life, I guess, for a Prince of Amber is part and party to all the rottenness that is in the world, which is why whenever I do speak of my conscience, something else within me must answer, "Ha!"  In the mirrors of the many judgments, my hands are the color of blood.  I am a part of the evil which exists to oppose other evils.  I destroy Melkins when I find them, and on that Great Day of which prophets speak but in which they do not truly believe, on that day when the world is completely cleansed of evil, then I, too, will go down into darkness, swallowing curses.  Perhaps even sooner than that, I now judge.  But whatever . . . Until that time, I shall not wash my hands nor let them hang useless." - Corwin of Amber (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Guns of Avalon</span>, The Chronicles of Amber, Vol. 1, pg 208-209).
