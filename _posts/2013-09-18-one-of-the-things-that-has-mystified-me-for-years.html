<blockquote>One of the things that has mystified me for years is the standard contempt that is shown for the suburbs. The first house that Nancy and I bought was a little postage stamp affair, and I resided it with T-111. We worked hard on that little thing, and I am incapable of thinking about that tiny house without my gratitude having about ten times more square footage than the house had. I would want to argue that this de rigeur contempt for the suburban middle class is yet another illustration of how unaware we are of the means God uses to bring people out of poverty, and how He enables them to provide their children with a better education than the parents had.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://dougwils.com/s7-engaging-the-culture/grinding-my-postmill-coffee-beans.html">Doug Wilson</a> â€” Regardless of whether you agree with Wilson or Carl Trueman on Christian Worldview and Transformationalism, this paragraph resonates with both the way I grew up and the way I live now.
