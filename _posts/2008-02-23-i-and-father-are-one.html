I had the privilege of preaching at Oakridge Community Church in Stillwater, MN last Sunday.  Here is the audio for the sermon titled <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://jasabell.home.comcast.net/downloads/20080217JesusandtheFatherareOne.mp3">I and the Father are One</a>.</span><br /><br />Please note that the last three minutes of the sermon were lost.  As it is now, it ends okay, but the final concluding thought and prayer were not recorded for some reason.<br /><br />UPDATE: The file has been fixed and the entire sermon is now available.
