“Sometimes it’s books or songs that tear away at the carefully crafted shackles we have allowed around our wrists, the bonds that blind us to the evident wonder of God’s great provision. Sometimes it’s a holy encounter with a saint. Sometimes it’s math, basketball, corn dogs, Victoria Falls, making love, babies, adoption, a painting, a person failing well, a fancy car, poetry, or water, or bread, or wine.”<br /><br />—<a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/2011/05/im-finite-how-are-you/">I’M FINITE, HOW ARE YOU?</a>, by S.
