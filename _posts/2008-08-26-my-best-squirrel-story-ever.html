We saw something moving across the road.  I slowed down and looked carefully.  A plastic cup, similar to a frappucino cup was moving across the road, pushed by a squirrel.  Then we realized that the squirrel had its head stuck in the bubble lid.<br /><br />It had to be hot in the cup, since it was about 85 degrees outside.  The squirrel couldn't see very well, because the cup was still coated with whip cream and coffee or whatever was in the cup.  I wonder if squirrels have bad breath.  I bet he was wishing he had brushed his teeth that morning.<br /><br />Jenny jumped out with her iPhone and took a picture.  I was trying to figure out if I could save the squirrel without touching it or getting bit by it.  It was moving slow enough that catching it was no problem, but they have sharp claws and it was still skittish.  If I stepped on its tail and pulled the lid at the same time I might be able to save it, but it might whip around and bite me or something.<br /><br />My flash decision was to simply grab the cup and yank as hard as I could, hoping the cup and lid would all come off at the same time.  Without additional thought, I reached down, grabbed the cup and yanked.  Squirrels are very light.  There was almost no resistance at all.  The squirrel went flying in the direction of my pull, but the cup stayed in my hand.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_p0aKmLIk4oY/SLRHo3ahCdI/AAAAAAAAACQ/j6SjcYIVkWo/s1600-h/photo.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_p0aKmLIk4oY/SLRHo3ahCdI/AAAAAAAAACQ/j6SjcYIVkWo/s320/photo.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5238891033934236114" /></a>Then I realized that the cup stayed in my hand, but not the lid!  By this time, the squirrel was bounding across the road and under the nearest car, clear plastic lid still stuck around its neck.  It couldn't run that well, but it could now see and breath.  At least I gave it a small chance to live when before it had none.<br /><br />I have no idea what has happened to the squirrel.  It may be able to eat, if it finds something, but I doubt that it can climb trees.  It is probably easy prey for bigger urban dwellers.<br /><br />Moral of the story: Don't litter!  Be Green!  If you don't it hurts the animals!<br /><br />(Tongue firmly planted in cheek.)
