It was also my first day of full-time work at Bethlehem Baptist Church after a 21-year career in civil engineering.  I put in a full day, and due to some emails, I left later than I would have normally.  I had told Wendy I would be home at 6:00 PM, but noticed the clock in the car was 5:52 PM when I drove out the parking lot.  I navigated the downtown traffic and merged onto I-35W.  I called Wendy to tell her I would be late as I crossed the bridge.  I looked at the clock, 6:00 PM.  I drove home, had dinner with my wife and kids, and did not know of the tragedy that happened moments behind me until around 8:30 PM that evening.<br /><br />How can we not believe in a sovereign God who causes the rain to fall and the sun to shine on both the just and the unjust?  He knows the numbers of hairs on our heads and a sparrow doesn't fall apart from him.  He ordains fish to swallow wayward prophets and worms to eat the roots of shade bearing plants.  He stores snow and controls whirlwinds.  He keeps bushes from burning and brings empires down with plagues.  God is an awesome God.<br /><br />The number one question that I should ask is why did the bridge not fall while I was on it?  I am a sinner just like everyone else on the bridge.  This is, as Jesus says in Luke 13:1-5, a warning call for repentance.  O my Lord, I repent.  Thank you for sparing my life and giving me a few more days.  Please, in your sovereignty, cause them to be glorifying to you.<br /><br />Please read what my pastor wrote about the bridge collapse.  It is worth your time.
