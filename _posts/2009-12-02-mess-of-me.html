Switchfoot's new album <span style="font-style: italic;">Hello Hurricane</span> is a lot of fun. It is loud and rowdy and has lots of Jon Foreman screaming. One of their songs, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/mess-me-acoustic-version/id335664374?i=335664519">Made a Mess of Me</a> (iTunes link) is an interesting look at total depravity, you know, from a pop/rock lyrical standpoint. The lyrics are below. I know crossing over is important, but it would be great if this song actually supplied the Gospel answer as well as stating the problem. I still really like the song, though.<br /><br />Mess of Me<br /><br />I am my own affliction<br />I am my own disease<br />There ain´t no drug that they could sell<br />Ah there ain´t no drugs to make me well<br /><br />There ain´t no drug<br />It´s not enough<br />There ain´t no drug<br />The sickness is myself<br /><br />- Chorus -<br />I made a mess of me I wanna get back the rest of me<br />I´ve made a mess of me I wanna spend the rest of my life alive<br />I´ve made a mess of me I wanna reverse this tragedy<br />I´ve made a mess of me I wanna spend the rest of my live alive<br />The rest of my life alive!<br /><br />We lock our souls in cages<br />We hide inside our shells<br />It´s hard to free to the ones you love<br />Oh when you can´t forgive yourself<br />Yeah forgive yourself!<br /><br />There ain´t no drug<br />There ain´t no drug<br />There ain´t no drug<br />The sickness is myself<br /><br />- Chorus -<br />I made a mess of me I wanna get back the rest of me<br />I´ve made a mess of me I wanna spend the rest of my life alive<br />I´ve made a mess of me I wanna reverse this tragedy<br />I´ve made a mess of me I wanna spend the rest of my live alive<br />The rest of my life alive!<br /><br />AHHHHHHOOOOO! Right<br /><br />There ain´t no drug<br />There ain´t no drug<br />There ain´t no drug<br />No drugs to make me well<br />There ain´t no drug<br />It´s not enough<br />I´m breaking up<br />The sickness is myself<br />The sickness is myself<br /><br />- Chorus -<br />I made a mess of me I wanna get back the rest of me<br />I´ve made a mess of me I wanna spend the rest of my life alive<br />I´ve made a mess of me I wanna reverse this tragedy<br />I´ve made a mess of me I wanna spend the rest of my live alive<br />The rest of my life alive!!
