"True freedom before God is the freedom to do what is right as God defines what is right."<br /><br />This quote is from <a href="http://www.dougwils.com/index.asp?Action=Anchor&amp;CategoryID=1&amp;BlogID=6499">Doug Wilson</a> when discussing Augustine's definition of freedom and free market systems. It is an excellent quote quite apart from that.<br /><br />I have an old tape where R.C. Sproul called this <span style="font-style: italic;">Royal Freedom</span>.<br /><br />I find it very interesting when people argue against the sovereignty of God over the salvation of men by saying that God is somehow restricting their freedom. What kind of freedom do you want, for goodness' sake? Freedom to sin, or true freedom?
