Here is the list of books I completed during the calendar year 2012. My goal is a minimum of 12 books completed per year, or an average of one per month. If I start a book in one year, and finish it in the next, it counts in the year it was completed. My sights are set low, but this way the goal is attainable. (Obviously, I am not shooting for stars and hoping for the moon: I am settling for clouds.)<div><br /></div><div>Caveats: 2012 was a difficult year, and I had great difficulty focusing on anything deep, difficult, or serious outside of work, which accounts for the proliferation of novels on this yearâ€™s list. Yes, I do feel a bit sheepish that the novels I read were more on the side of escapist fiction than classic literature, but I think G.K. Chesterton had it right <a href="http://theabellsix.blogspot.com/2011/08/hero-among-dragons.html">here</a>, <a href="http://theabellsix.blogspot.com/2011/09/slay-dragon.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://theabellsix.blogspot.com/2011/03/what-do-we-choose-to-imagine.html">here</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also previously posted on books read in <a href="http://theabellsix.blogspot.com/2012/01/books-completed-in-2011.html">2011</a>, <a href="http://theabellsix.blogspot.com/2011/01/books-completed-in-2010.html">2010</a>, and <a href="http://theabellsix.blogspot.com/2010/12/books-read.html">2008/2009</a>.<br /><br /><i>Cover Her Face,</i> by P.
