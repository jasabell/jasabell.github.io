Christopher Hitchens with advice to writers in a recent <i>Vanity Fair</i> <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/06/christopher-hitchens-unspoken-truths-201106?printable=true&amp;currentPage=all">article</a>:<br /><blockquote>“Don’t say that as a boy your grandmother used to read to you, unless at that stage of her life she really was a boy, in which case you have probably thrown away a better intro.”</blockquote><div>I am currently reading <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-50th-Anniversary/dp/0205632645/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305480200&amp;sr=1-1-fkmr0">The Elements of Style</a></i>, by Strunk and White...</div><blockquote><b>Rule 7. A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject.</b> Participial phrases preceded by a conjunction or by a preposition, nouns in apposition, adjectives, and adjective phrases come under the same rule if they begin a sentence.</blockquote><div>(HT: <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/between2worlds/~3/uuPRAejKPgk/">Justin Taylor</a>)</div>
