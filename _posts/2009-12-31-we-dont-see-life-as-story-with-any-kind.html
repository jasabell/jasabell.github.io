Christianity is no longer about changing the world. Christianity is no longer about facing the darkness and walking into shadow with souls full of light. We don't see evil as a thing to be conquered, we don't see life as a story with any kind of arc. We don't want our God to be the God of falcons and mole rats and skunk justice.<br /><br />â€”N. D. Wilson, <span style="font-style: italic;">Notes from the Tilt-A-Whirl</span>, p. 152
