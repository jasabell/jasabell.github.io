<a href="http://www.dougwils.com/">Douglas Wilson</a> points his acerbic wit towards “seven memes for keeping Christians in their place” in a post today.

Biblical faith stifles and deadens the aesthetic soul.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>I will not say much here, except to note that I do not believe that the builders of Salisbury Cathedral, the composer of the Brandenburg concertos, the painter of The Night Watch, or the writer of Paradise Lost, have anything to apologize for in the thin shade of Kanye West, John Cage, Jackson Pollock, Walter Gropius, or Barry Manilow.</blockquote>Read the whole <a href="http://www.dougwils.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8604:seven-memes-for-keeping-christians-in-their-place&amp;catid=146:mere-christendom">thing</a>.
