I have a very dear <a href="http://theworksofgod.com/author/johnknightsr/">friend</a> who has suffered much. He is the most joyful man I know. I am reposting his <a href="http://theworksofgod.com/2011/05/03/if-i-might-only-have-it-to-utter-one-sentence-it-would-be-this-one-spurgeon/">blog entry</a> from today because his quote of Spurgeon is so good. You should <a href="http://theworksofgod.com/feed/">subscribe</a> to his blog and see a man who knows what it means to be “sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.”<br /><blockquote><blockquote>I do not know what you need, but I do know Christ has it. I do not know the full of your disease, but I do know Christ is the physician who can meet it. <b>I do not know how hard and stubborn and stolid and ignorant and blind and dead your nature may be, but I do know that “Christ is able to save unto the uttermost them that come unto God by Him.”</b> What you are has nothing to do with the question, except that it is the mischief to be undone. The true answer to the question of how you are to be saved lies yonder in the bleeding body of the immaculate Lamb of God! Christ has all salvation in Himself. He is Alpha, He is Omega. He does not begin to save and leave you to perish, nor does He offer to complete what you must first begin. . .</blockquote><blockquote><b>If I might only have it to utter one sentence, it would be this one, “Your help is found in Christ.”</b> As for you, there never can be found anything hopeful in your human nature. It is death itself! It is rottenness and corruption. Turn, turn your eyes away from this despairing mass of black depravity and look to Christ! He is the sacrifice for human guilt. His is the righteousness that covers men and makes them acceptable before the Lord!</blockquote><blockquote>—Charles H. Spurgeon, <a href="http://www.spurgeongems.org/vols10-12/chs654.pdf"><i>Memory: The Handmaid of Hope</i></a>, delivered October 15, 1865.</blockquote></blockquote>
