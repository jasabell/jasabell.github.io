One of the things that makes a story a good story is when all the loose threads are tied up in the end.  A story that weaves an intricate tapestry but leaves many threads untied at the end is not satisfying.  When all loose ends are tied up and everything is accounted for, then the tapestry (or the story) is that much more beautiful and satisfying.<br /><br />If one considers all of history -- redemption history -- a story, then it seems reasonable to hope that all the threads of human history will be tied up nicely a the end.  I believe that God, as the premier storyteller, will make sure that all the loose ends are tied up.  In other words, the reason for cancer, wars, car accidents, theft, betrayal, tsunamis, hurricanes, plane crashes, crib death, drugs, and a million other sufferings will be beautifully explained <span style="font-style: italic;">and satisfying</span> by the time we read the last page.<br /><br />To live this life believing in anything else would lead me, at least, to despair.<br /><br />“Remember this and stand firm, recall it to mind, you transgressors, remember the former things of old; for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, ‘My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose,’ calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country.  I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed, and I will do it.”  (Isaiah 46:8-11)
