<span style="font-weight: bold;">19</span> Behold, at that time I  will deal with all your oppressors.<br />And I will save the lame and gather the outcast,<br />and I will change their shame into praise and renown in all the earth.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">20</span> At that time I will  bring you in, at the time when I gather you together;<br />for I will make you renowned and praised among all the peoples of the earth,<br />when I restore your fortunes before your eyes,” says the Lord.<br /><br />—Zephaniah 3:19–20
