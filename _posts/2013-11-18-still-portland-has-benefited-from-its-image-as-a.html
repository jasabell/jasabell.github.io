<blockquote>Still, Portland has benefited from its image as a fashionable city: According to research by Greg Schrock and Jason Jurjevich, two urban-studies scholars at Portland State, Portland has been one of the top cities attracting young, college-educated people for the past 30 years. But there might be something to the notion that Portland is a bit like the city depicted in the satirical television show <em>Portlandia</em>, &ldquo;where young people go to retire.&rdquo; Their research shows that young, college-educated folks in Portland have the highest rates of unemployment of all major metro areas in the nation, and they tend to be underemployed or working in &ldquo;non-college occupations,&rdquo; like food service.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Portland-State-U-Ties-Its/142881/">&ldquo;Portland State U.
