This was a welcome surpise since virtually all of the previous snow had been melted and we had several days with temperatures in the fifties.<br /><br />Then, on Thursday we had another seven inches of snow.  So, in the space of four days we had sixteen inches of snow.  It has been a lot of fun, especially for the kids.  The temperature has stayed around 29-31 degrees, so it hasn't melted much.<br /><br />Today, however, it is warmer and the snow is starting to melt, but since there is so much snow, it won't melt too fast.<br /><br />This is probably Old Man Winter's last gasp.  Spring starts in a few days.
