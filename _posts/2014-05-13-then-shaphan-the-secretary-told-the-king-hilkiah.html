<blockquote>Then Shaphan the secretary told the king, &ldquo;Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.&rdquo; And Shaphan read it before the king.</blockquote>&#8212;2 Kings 22:10 â€” This is an unbelievably moving moment in the history of Israel. Josiah valiantly tried to do what was right for Judah, but it was too little, too late.
