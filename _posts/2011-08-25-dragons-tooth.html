This book arrives at theAbellsix doorstep today. We can’t wait. Wendy and I listened as the author read the first chapter to us back in June and are so excited to read the rest. My kids have been fighting over who gets to read it first for months. First to the door wins!<br /><br /><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-14079 alignleft" height="223" src="http://www.rabbitroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Ashtown+Burials+Dragons+Tooth.jpg" title="Ashtown+Burials+Dragons+Tooth" width="148" /><br /><br />From the RabbitRoom review...<br /><blockquote>Which brings us to choices. Cyrus and Antigone face the age-old choice of doing what is easy versus doing what is right. Turning away from the Order of Brendan would allow them to grieve for their family, remain safe, and stay together. But Dan has been given the Dragon’s Tooth, the Reaper’s Blade, with the power of death. Immortals can die and the dead can be raised with the tooth’s power. Enemies want it and will kill to get it. At one point Cyrus is offered his family in return for the tooth. Give the tooth (and all personal risk and responsibility) and save his family. Or keep the tooth (and the risk and responsibility toward a greater good) and possibly lose his loved ones. Easy? Or right?</blockquote>Read the whole <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/2011/08/new-from-n-d-wilson-the-dragon%E2%80%99s-tooth/">thing</a>.
