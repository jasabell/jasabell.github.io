It is usual to speak in a playfully apologetic tone about one's adult enjoyment of what are called 'children's books'. I think the convention a silly one. No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally (and often far more) worth reading at the age of fifty—except, of course, books of information. The only imaginative works we ought to grow out of are those which it would have been better not to have read at all. A mature palate will probably not much care for <span style="font-style: italic;">creme de methe</span>: but it ought still to enjoy bread and butter and honey.<br /><br />—C. S. Lewis, "On Stories," <span style="font-style: italic;">On Stories and Other Essays on Literature</span>, p. 14.
