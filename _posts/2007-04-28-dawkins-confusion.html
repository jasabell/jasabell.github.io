<span class="artdeck"><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/bc/2007/002/1.21.html">Naturalism <span class="arttext">ad absurdum</span>.</a>  Read a rebuttal of Dawkins </span><span class="artbyline">by Alvin Plantinga.<br /><br /></span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0618680004/christianitytoda" class="artcite" target="_blank"></a><blockquote><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0618680004/christianitytoda" class="artcite" target="_blank">The God Delusion</a> is an extended diatribe against religion in general and belief in God in particular; Dawkins and Daniel Dennett (whose recent <i>Breaking the Spell</i> is his contribution to this genre) are the touchdown twins of current academic atheism. Dawkins has written his book, he says, partly to encourage timorous atheists to come out of the closet. He and Dennett both appear to think it requires considerable courage to attack religion these days; says Dennett, "I risk a fist to the face or worse. Yet I persist." Apparently atheism has its own heroes of the faithâ€”at any rate its own self-styled heroes. Here it's not easy to take them seriously; religion-bashing in the current Western academy is about as dangerous as endorsing the party's candidate at a Republican rally.</blockquote>
