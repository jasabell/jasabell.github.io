Okay, I am totally naive, know next to nothing about the financial crisis, and don't know who I am going to vote for, only who I am NOT going to vote for.  It would seem then, that I shouldn't post anything here about what I don't know, right?  It would seem.  But, Doug Wilson makes so much sense, and I laugh out loud.  How else can we survive these days if we can't laugh out loud?<br /><blockquote>When you are doing something crazy, and it causes problems, then stop it. If you are doing something big crazy, and it causes bigger problems, this should not be taken as an argument for doing something even bigger crazy. What is the way out of this mysterious crisis? Well stop doing what causes it. Or, to use the biblical word for it, we need a dose of repentance.<br /><br />The bubble has burst, as every financial bubble in the history of the world has always done, and yet, somehow, all the cheerleaders of the bubblefication have not lost their credibility. They are still on the teevee, cheerleading for the latest rescue of the previous rescue of the first rescue. And someone like Ron Paul, who has been shown to be in the right about all this foolishness, talks sense for a few minutes. But everyone knows that that is not realistic. I mean, come on.<br /><br />It reminds me of poor Jeremiah in Egypt. Everything he said about what idolatry would do to Israel came true, in agonizing detail. Every prediction, every denunciation, every tear -- every last one of them was shown to be, you know, true. And yet, once they were down in Egypt, up pop some wise johnnies who clearly saw that all this had happened because they hadn't worshipped the Queen of Heaven <span style="font-style: italic;">enough</span>. Huh.</blockquote>(HT: <a href="http://www.dougwils.com/index.asp?Action=Anchor&amp;CategoryID=1&amp;BlogID=5969">Douglas Wilson</a>)
