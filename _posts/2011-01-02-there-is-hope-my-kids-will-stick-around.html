“At the Q gathering in 2010, urbanologist Richard Florida observed that young adults meeting one another no longer ask, ‘What do you do?’ They ask, ‘Where do you live?’ More and more people will change careers in order to stay in a place—connected to family, friends, and local culture—than will change place to stay in a career. The 20th-century American dream was to move out and move up; the 21st-century dream seems to be to put down deeper roots. This quest for local, embodied, physical presence may well be driven by the omnipresence of the virtual and a dawning awareness of the thinness of disembodied life.”<br /><br />— <a href="http://qideas.org/blog/ten-most-significant-cultural-trends-of-the-last-decade.aspx">Ten Most Significant Cultural Trends of the Last Decade : Andy Crouch</a><br /><div><br /></div><div>(HT: <a href="http://ayjay.tumblr.com/post/2567322098">More Than 95 Theses</a>)</div>
