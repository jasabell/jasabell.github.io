That's more than 115,000 games!</blockquote><blockquote>The application uses a combination of a Cover Flow and grid-style interface that makes it easy to browse by team names and by team geographic location. When you are viewing the information on an individual team, you can view each game within a season, plus performance statistics such as batting average and earned run averages for each season as a whole.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>These two views only scratch the surface of the statistics that are available within Pennant. Each season can be further broken down into individual games, a view that lets you see the details and player roster for each game.&nbsp;</blockquote></blockquote>
