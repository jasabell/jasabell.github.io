you who live in heaven<br />hear the prayers of those of us who live on earth<br />who are afraid of being left by those we love<br />and who get hardened by the hurt<br />do you remember when you lived down here<br />where we all scrape to find the faith to ask for daily bread<br />did you forget about us after you had flown away<br />well I have memorized every word you said<br />still I'm so scared I'm holding my breath<br />while you're up there just playing hard to get<br /><br />you who live in radiance<br />hear the prayers of those of us who live in skin<br />we have a love that's not as patient as yours was<br />still we do love now and then<br />did you ever know loneliness<br />did you ever know need<br />do you remember just how long a night can get<br />when you are barely holding on and your friends fall asleep<br />and don't see the blood that's running in your sweat<br />will those who mourn be left uncomforted<br />while you're up there just playing hard to get<br /><br />and I know you bore our sorrows<br />and I know you feel our pain<br />and I know that it would not hurt any less<br />even if it could be explained<br />and I know that I am only lashing out<br />at the one who loves me most<br />and after I have figured this<br />somehow what I really need to know is<br /><br />if you who live in eternity<br />hear the prayers of those of us who live in time<br />who can't see what's ahead<br />and we cannot get free from what we've left behind<br />I'm reeling from these voices that keep screaming in my ears<br />all these words of shame and doubt, blame and regret<br />I can't see how your leading me, unless you've led me here<br />to where I am lost enough to let myself be led<br />and so, you've been here all along I guess<br />it's just your ways and you are just plain hard to get<br /><br />Rich Mullins, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Jesus Demos</span>, 1998.
