We have exciting news.  Our bestest friends are going to fly their family out from good ol' Vancouver, WA to visit us next week.  Trevis and Rebecca and the kids will be here next Wednesday.  It should be a great time to catch up and share life together.<br /><br />Also, in case you are interested, Pastor Piper had his prostate removed on Tuesday of this week.  The surgery went "beautifully."  He is home now and recuperating.  Please continue to pray for him, if you think of it.  You can read the update <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/news_events/dgm_news/2006/20060106_cancer_announcement.html">here.</a><br /><br />The kids are having a blast watching the Olympics.  We normally don't watch any TV anymore, but we all enjoy the Olympics, so we have had the TV on a lot lately.  Chase really enjoyed the snow boarding.  Shawn White is now a household name around here.  The girls are enjoying the figure skating.<br /><br />It is amazing to see their imagination: the games around the house now revolve around the Olympics.  They fight over who gets to be Michelle Kwan or Emily Hughes or whoever.  I don't even know all their names.  Well, Chase gets to be Shawn White.  He is not fighting over girl names.  I guess it is better than role playing Luke Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi.
