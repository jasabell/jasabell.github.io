I am working at home today and my son came down and asked if he could ask me a question. Sure.<br /><br />"I am reading 1 Samuel 15 for <a href="http://www.veritaspress.com/products.asp?dept=1071">Omnibus</a> today and I read that God regretted that he made Saul king over Israel. Since God ordained everything that takes place, how can this be real regret?"<br /><br />What does a father say? With a big, thankful gulp, I offered a silent prayer of gratitude to a God who would bless me with a son who thinks while he reads and is not afraid to ask hard questions.<br /><br />I grabbed my Bible and turned to 1 Sam 15. I then pointed out not only the verse at 1 Sam 15:35, but also 1 Sam 15:29. "Son, how can God not be able to regret <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> regret six verses later?"<br /><br />Blank stare. The dawning recognition of a deeper complication. "I don't know."<br /><br />I would have loved to just tell him what I believe. But I wanted him to go read it somewhere. Maybe that is still telling him, but it would be good for him to read someone other than me.<br /><br />I sent him <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/TasteAndSee/ByDate/1987/3683_The_Repentance_of_God/">here</a>.<br /><br />Praise God.
