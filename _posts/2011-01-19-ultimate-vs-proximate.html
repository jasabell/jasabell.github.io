I am re-posting this from my friend’s blog <a href="http://theworksofgod.com/2011/01/19/really-bad-things-do-happen-to-us-r-c-sproul/">The Works of God</a>. I find Sproul’s distinction between ultimate and proximate very helpful.<br /><blockquote>R.C. Sproul on Romans 8:28:<br /><blockquote>God, in his providence, has the power and the will to work <i>all things</i> together for good for his people. This does not mean that everything that happens to us is, in itself, good. &nbsp;Really bad things do happen to us. They are only proximately bad; they are never ultimately bad. That is, they are bad only in the short (proximate) term, never in the long term. Because of the triumph of God’s goodness in all things, he is able to bring good for us out of the bad. He turns our tragedies into supreme blessings.</blockquote>R.C. Sproul, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Still-Soul-Embracing-Provision-Suffering/dp/1433511851/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1295391359&amp;sr=8-3"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black;">Be Still, My Soul: Embracing God’s Purpose and Provision in Suffering</span></a>, edited by Nancy Guthrie, p. 47.</blockquote>(HT: <a href="http://theworksofgod.com/">The Works of God</a>)
