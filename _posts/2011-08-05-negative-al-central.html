Rob Neyer writes about the runs-scored differential in the AL Central...<br /><blockquote>[As of August 5,] The first-place Tigers have been outscored by seven runs. The second-place Indians have been outscored by seven runs. The third-place White Sox have been outscored by 30 runs. And the fourth-place Twins, you don't even wanna know about.</blockquote>The <a href="http://mlb.sbnation.com/2011/8/5/2345926/a-l-central-standings-update">whole</a> thing.
