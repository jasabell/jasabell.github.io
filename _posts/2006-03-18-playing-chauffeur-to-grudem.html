Nine times in two years our church holds TBI seminars that are open to the whole church and required for the TBI Track 2 guys.  These seminars include topics like, Desiring God, TULIP, Future Grace, Why We Believe the Bible, etc.<br /><br />Last night and this morning was the seminar on Gender Complimentarianism.  This is the idea that the genders complement each other.  In other words, men and women are equal before God, yet have different roles.<br /><br />Because Pastor Piper is on sabbatical in Europe, he did not teach the seminar.  Instead, his good friend, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Grudem">Dr. Wayne Grudem</a>, taught the seminar.  Since coming to BBC, this is the fourth time that I have seen Dr. Grudem live.<br /><br />Dr. Grudem has had a big impact on my spiritual development as I found his major book, Systematic Theology, back in the late nineties.  It has been very influential in my learning.<br /><br />In getting to the point, Wendy and I had the honor of driving Dr. Grudem to and from his hotel to the seminar today.  It was a joy to ride with him and talk to him about his children and family and his career.<br /><br />Anyway, it was a small joy for us, and another of those neat things that have happened to us since we came to Bethlehem Baptist Church.
