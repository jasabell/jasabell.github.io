The post just before this one, titled “Your Help is Found in Christ,” was the 300th post on this blog.<br /><br />I didn’t think about it or plan it, but it is fitting that a milestone, small or big, be accented by the saving work of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br /><br />“So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31).
