<blockquote>Wisdom from G. K. Chesterton: “If the characters are not wicked, the book is.” We must tell stories the way God does, stories in which a sister must float her little brother on a river with nothing but a basket between him and the crocodiles. Stories in which a king is a coward, and a shepherd boy steps forward to face the giant. Stories with fiery serpents and leviathans and sermons in whirlwinds. Stories in which murderers are blinded on donkeys and become heroes. Stories with dens of lions and fiery furnaces and lone prophets laughing at kings and priests and demons. Stories with heads on platters. Stories with courage and crosses and redemption. Stories with resurrections.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/january-february/dark-tinted-truth-filled-reading-list-our-kids-need.html">The Dark-Tinted, Truth-Filled Reading List We Owe Our Kids: Stories can teach about real-life evil—and the God who overcomes it.</a> N.D.
