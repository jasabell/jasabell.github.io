Have you ever noticed that the Bible <i style="">commands</i> you to feel something?<span style="">  </span>Here are some texts: “Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord” (Rom 12:11).<span style="">  </span>“And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul?” (Deut 10:12).<span style="">  </span>“Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.<span style="">  </span>You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might” (Deut 6:4, 5).<span style="">  </span>“Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice” (Phil 4:4).<br /><br />In addition to commanding affections (an eighteenth century word for emotion), the Bible also expects Christians to have a certain kind of emotion: “Though you have not seen him, you love him.<span style="">  </span>Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory” (1 Pet 1:8).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_p0aKmLIk4oY/RkP0TcBf43I/AAAAAAAAAA8/9SE8NU8xTeo/s1600-h/edwards1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt;

we are to love our neighbor as our self.<span style="">  </span>Nevertheless, when it comes to God, is love only a verb, or is it part verb and part state of being?<span style="">  </span>What about joy?<span style="">  </span>Yes, we are to rejoice, but what do we do when Peter declares we rejoice <i style="">with joy</i>?<br /><br />The point of this discussion is that when we examine our faith and our Christian walk, we need to examine the state of our affections.<span style="">  </span>For Christians, affections are not necessarily charismatic outward signs.<span style="">  </span>We don’t have to raise our hands and cry and be overcome during worship.<span style="">  </span>But we <i style="">must feel something!</i><span style="">  </span>If we do not feel anything, we are at the best disobedient, and at the worst not even Christian.<span style="">  </span>Peter’s statement is present tense: “though you do not now see him, you [do now presently] love him and you [presently] believe in him and you [presently] rejoice with inexpressible joy.”<span style="">  </span>This is how, in great part, our Christian lives should be.<br /><br />I beg you to chase this idea down.<span style="">  </span>Summer is a good time to read.<span style="">  </span>Pick up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1595479473/ref=s9_asin_image_1-2288_p/102-3906664-5323320?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=1Q3TG18VA9AM4XZ9HS9D&pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=288448501&pf_rd_i=507846"><i style="">Religious Affections</i></a> and read it for yourself.<span style="">  </span>Here are some quotes from Edwards:<span style="">  </span>“God has given to mankind affections….<span style="">  </span>And yet how common is it among mankind, that their affections are much more exercised and engaged in other matters…which concern men’s worldly interest, their outward delights, their honor and reputation, and their natural relations….<span style="">  </span>How they can sit and hear of the infinite height and depth and length and breadth of the love of God in Christ Jesus, of his giving his infinitely dear Son, to be offered up a sacrifice for the sins of men, and of the unparalleled love of the innocent, holy and tender Lamb of God, manifested in his dying agonies, his bloody sweat, his loud and bitter cries, and bleeding heart, and all this for enemies, to redeem them from deserved, eternal burnings, and to bring to unspeakable and everlasting joy and glory; and yet be cold, and heavy and insensible and regardless!<span style="">  </span>Where are the exercises of our affections proper if not here?<span style="">  </span>….<span style="">  </span>How great cause have we therefore to be humbled to the dust, that we are no more affected!”<span style="">  </span>(Edwards, Religious Affections, Yale, 122-124.)
