This quote is from a blog <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/?p=12123">post</a> advertising a Christian artist conference, and furthermore, from <i>The Jesus Storybook Bible</i>, but it is a great quote nonetheless:<br /><blockquote>“The Bible is most of all a Story. It’s an adventure story about a young Hero who comes from a far country to win back his lost treasure. It’s a love story about a brave Prince who leaves his palace, his throne - everything - to rescue the one he loves. It’s like the most wonderful of fairy tales that has come true in real life!”</blockquote>I love good fairy tales.
