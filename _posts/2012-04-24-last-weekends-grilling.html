<b>Friday</b>: Mesquite Smoked Cheeseburgers (Sorry the pic is a bit blurry. Can’t take another picture, though, the burgers are all gone.) The salsa included mesquite smoked Roma tomatoes (yes, on the grill) along with fresh onions, garlic, cilantro, chipotle chili peppers in adobo sauce, and lime juice. The burgers were grilled in mesquite smoke and topped with smoked Gouda. Absolutely fantastic.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FdPf5KCGDSs/T5c2p55oKKI/AAAAAAAAAPk/Nr06pihUixw/s1600/Mesquite+Burger.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FdPf5KCGDSs/T5c2p55oKKI/AAAAAAAAAPk/Nr06pihUixw/s400/Mesquite+Burger.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Saturday</b>: Hickory Smoked Baby Back Ribs. These babies were seasoned with kosher salt, chipotle pepper powder, cumin, garlic powder and black pepper (plus some others I can’t remember right now), then sat for a little over an hour. I prepared a three-zone fire for indirect heat and tried to keep the internal temperature between 300 and 350 degrees. They were on the grill about 3 hours, basking in hickory smoke for the first two. They were very good, maybe the best I’ve grilled so far, but I think I still have a long way to go to make perfect ribs.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CfZhj0-RinU/T5c2oPbd0II/AAAAAAAAAPc/v6Oqzd44Qg4/s1600/Hickory+Smoked+Ribs.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CfZhj0-RinU/T5c2oPbd0II/AAAAAAAAAPc/v6Oqzd44Qg4/s400/Hickory+Smoked+Ribs.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />
