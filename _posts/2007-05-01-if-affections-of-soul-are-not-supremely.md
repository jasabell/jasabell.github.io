"If the affections of the soul are not supremely fixed on God, and if our dominant desire and primary goal is not to possess God's favor and to promote His glory, then we are traitors in revolt against our lawful Sovereign....Whether we are the slaves of avarice, sensuality, amusement, sloth, or the devotees of ambition, taste, or fashion, we alike estrange ourselves from the dominion of our rightful Sovereign." <span id="st" name="st" class="st"></span><span id="st" name="st" class="st"></span><br /><br />---William Wilberforce<br /><br />(HT: <a href="http://www.breakpoint.org">Breakpoint</a>)<br /><span style="font-size:78%;"></span>
