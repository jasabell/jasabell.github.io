From <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/01/11/verizon-iphone-4-preinstalled">Daring Fireball</a>:<br /><blockquote><a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/01/pics-of-the-new-antenna-wifi-sharing-prefs-on-verizon-iphone.ars">Ars Technica reports</a>:</blockquote><blockquote>Apple’s own Phil Schiller assured the press that Verizon would not be loading up the device with crapware, too. “We want the experience to be the same for every iPhone user. So there are no special Verizon Apps preinstalled,” Schiller told Ars. “AT&amp;T offers customers some apps via the App Store. I’ll let Verizon comment if they are working on anything for that.”</blockquote><blockquote>I.e., the Verizon iPhone is just another iPhone 4. No logos on the hardware. No preloaded apps from the carrier.</blockquote>
