Ron was silent for a moment. Then he spoke. "Sometimes standing against evil is more important than defeating it. The greatest heroes stand because it is right to do so, not because they believe they will walk away with their lives. Such selfless courage is a victory in itself."<br /><br />—N. D. Wilson, <span style="font-style: italic;">Dandelion Fire</span>, pp. 172–173
