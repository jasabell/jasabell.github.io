<a href="http://www.bcsmn.org/">BCS</a> recently announced that we are hiring <a href="http://www.bcsmn.org/index.php/news/item/naselli-joins-bcs-faculty">Andy Naselli</a> as our new Assistant Professor of New Testament and Biblical Theology. I am very excited about him coming on staff and his family being a part of our community at BCS. I really like Andy and look forward to years of service together for the furtherance of our mission.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I laughed out loud when I read the following sentences on his <a href="http://www.andynaselli.com/">blog</a>, where he was describing <a href="http://andynaselli.com/were-moving-to-minneapolis-5-reasons-were-excited-to-serve-at-bethlehem-college-and-seminary">five reasons</a> why he was coming to BCS.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">On Christmas Day 1998, I read <i>The Pleasures of God</i>. I was riveted.</blockquote>Riveted? Iâ€™ll say. I would have been starving. And tired. And late for work. Probably a week late.
