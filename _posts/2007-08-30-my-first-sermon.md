Clicking on the link below will play the very first sermon that I ever preached to a congregation.  I had taught in Sunday school situations for over five years, but had never preached.  Various circumstances, including our decision to leave Vancouver, WA for seminary, led to this opportunity.  On June 6, 2004, I preached this sermon to a total of about 650 people spread across three services.  I believe this audio is from the second service.  If you listen to John Piper often, you will recognize much from this sermon.<br /><br /><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~jasabell/01_Quest_for_Joy_1.mp3">Quest for Joy</a><br /><br />Despite my inexperience, it is my prayer and hope that my passion for the Glory of God is apparent.
