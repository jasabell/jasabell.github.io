There are activities that seem to fall into a few different camps. The camps are Love to Do, Hate to Do, Good At, and Bad At. Any activity can have the following permutations...<br /><br />1. Love to Do and Good At<br />2. Love to Do and Bad At<br />3. Hate to Do and Good At<br />4. Hate to Do and Bad At<br /><br />Camps one and four tend to take care of themselves. Sometimes people are stuck in camp three and need to figure out a way not to be there.<br /><br />But what about camp two? How much effort should we put into those activities that fall into camp two? If we love to sing, but canâ€™t sing, should we do it? If we love to run or write or fish or swim or study or whatever, but really stink at it, should we continue to put energy into it for the sake of our joy, or should we bag it and find things that only fall into camp one?
