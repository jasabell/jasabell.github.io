It is raining relatively hard, lighting is slamming the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telefarm_Towers_Shoreview">Shoreview Towers</a>, and thunder is rolling across the sky from south to north.<br /><br />My family is at the library, all the windows are open, the smell of rain is everywhere, and I am sitting at my computer with a large mug of steaming hot coffee in my hand and an eclectic mix of tunes flowing from my playlist.<br /><br />It really is glorious.<br /><br />Job 28:23       “God understands the way to it,<br />        and he knows its place.<br />24     For he looks to the ends of the earth<br />        and sees everything under the heavens.<br />25     When he gave to the wind its weight<br />        and apportioned the waters by measure,<br />26     when he made a decree for the rain<br />        and a way for the lightning of the thunder,<br />27     then he saw it and declared it;<br />        he established it, and searched it out.<br />28     And he said to man,<br />     ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom,<br />        and to turn away from evil is understanding.’”
