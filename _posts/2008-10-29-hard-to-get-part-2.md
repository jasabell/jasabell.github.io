In regard to a <a href="http://theabellsix.blogspot.com/2008/10/christian-music.html">previous post</a> on Christian music and where all the good music went, I have been pondering what music I listened to in the 1990s.  Clearly, the most listened to musician for me in the 90s was Rich Mullins.  In a sad turn of providence he was killed in a freak car accident on September 19, 1997.<div><br /></div><div>Fortunately, before he died he recorded a demo cassette tape of songs he wrote for an upcoming album.  He recorded the tape with just himself, a piano, a guitar, and a cassette recorder in an old church building on an indian reservation.</div><div><br /></div><div>In 1998, the two disk album was released, titled <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">The Jesus Record</span>.  Disk one was Rich's actual demo tape, and disk two was a monstrosity of covers by Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, et al.  They really shouldn't have.</div><div><br /></div><div>Regardless, Rich's song <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Hard to Get</span> is clearly one of his best songs ever.  The church recording is haunting in its simplicity and touches the soul at a deeper level than anything that would have been produced by a record company.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Ku-tFT_pZ4s&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Ku-tFT_pZ4s&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /></div>
