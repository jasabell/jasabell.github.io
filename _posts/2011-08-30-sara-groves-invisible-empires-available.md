Saraâ€™s brand new album, <i><a href="http://www.saragroves.com/">Invisible Empires</a></i>, is available right now for pre-order and download. I love waking up to surprises like this.<br /><br />Sara Groves has been a family favorite since the late nineties when her song, <i>The Word</i>, came out. Little did we know then that we would end up living in the Twin Cities, where she lives, see her at Bethlehem, and in multiple concerts. Her vocals and words and thoughts touch our family in deep ways. My daughters fall asleep listening to her music and my wife and I play her stuff throughout the year. She is perennially in our playlist.<br /><br />Wendy has already listened to this new album all the way through. We heartily recommend it.
