You have to read this.  Justin Taylor provides the closing paragraphs to an article by a feminist liberal woman named Camille Paglia.  This woman has unashamedly admitted the logical end result of her worldview.  The following is a quote to shock you:<br /><br /><blockquote>But the pro-life position, whether or not it is based on religious orthodoxy, is more ethically highly evolved than my own tenet of unconstrained access to abortion on demand. My argument (as in my first book, "Sexual Personae,") has always been that nature has a master plan pushing every species toward procreation and that it is our right and even obligation as rational human beings to defy nature's fascism. Nature herself is a mass murderer, making casual, cruel experiments and condemning 10,000 to die so that one more fit will live and thrive.<br /><br />Hence I have always frankly admitted that abortion is murder, the extermination of the powerless by the powerful. Liberals for the most part have shrunk from facing the ethical consequences of their embrace of abortion, which results in the annihilation of concrete individuals and not just clumps of insensate tissue. The state in my view has no authority whatever to intervene in the biological processes of any woman's body, which nature has implanted there before birth and hence before that woman's entrance into society and citizenship.</blockquote><br />Read Justin's article <a href="http://theologica.blogspot.com/2008/09/camille-paglia.html">here</a>.<br /><br />Read the whole article <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/paglia/2008/09/10/palin/print.html">here</a>.
