Okay, I have been driven to write this post because of what is going on in our house and the recent posts of 1) a <a href="http://preciseandtowering.tumblr.com/post/54162324/my-top-5-artists-week-ending-2008-10-5">friend</a>, and 2) an <a href="http://twentytwowords.com/2008/10/13/charles-wesley-and-isaac-watts-vs-adam-duritz-and-lisa-loeb/">acquaintance</a>.<br /><br />We have become tired of the “contemporary Christian music” that is played on the local radio station.  It is fluff and family friendly and all that other blah.  Most of it doesn’t seem to line up with the real Christianity that I read about in the Bible or live every day.  Where is the suffering?  Where is joy in Christ despite the crush of sin and oppression?<br /><br />We have attempted to survive by turning off the radio and listening to good music with deep Christian themes from the likes of Derek Webb, Sara Groves, and Sandra McCracken.  But I have noticed that the current iTunes playlist has more Billy Joel, Tom Petty, Hootie and the Blowfish, and the Wallflowers than Christian music.<br /><br />So here are my questions:  1) where did the good Christian music go?  2) Which decade of secular music was better, 70s, 80s, or 90s?  3) Do you think I am a bad Christian because I actually stepped outside the box and have listened to secular music?  4) Why do most Christian radio stations play fluff instead of deep lyrics grounded in the Bible and theology?<br /><br />I know that more than two people read this blog (the three of you know who you are), so I would love answers in the comments.
