I have spent the last four hours alone while Wendy and the kids were out. It is interesting that I can miss them so much when I love being alone as much as I do. Yet, it is clear that simply having them around, knowing they are in the next room, and having them bust in and ask questions or give me a hug is really the preferred reality.
