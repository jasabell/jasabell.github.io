I snoop around the <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/">Rabbit Room</a> because I like its <a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com/">proprietor</a>.<br /><br />There are two beautiful paragraphs in an excellent article written by <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/author/lanier/">Lanier Ivester</a> that I am going to repost here. If you have any desire to create art in you—of whatever kind—read the <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/2011/05/gods-own-fool/">whole thing</a>.<br /><blockquote>I don’t want to fail. I want to sing the songs of Eden to a tired and homesick world. I want to write of beauty and truth and goodness, unashamed; I want to spin words and weave stories that will make other people know they are not alone. But even this ambition, sweet as it is, comes short of the mark. For if I truly believe that in attempting to write a book I am being obedient to something that God has placed within me, then His pleasure is the final word. It will not matter in the least whether I succeed in the temporal sense or fail utterly. In the words of the immortal Rumpole, it will be “a matter of indifference bordering on the supernatural”. Supernatural, indeed. For only faith’s vision can incite a recklessness of that ilk, that caliber of abandon that has made the disciples of Christ stand out from their kin like stark raving lunatics from the first <i>Year of our Lord</i> until now. God help me to be among them.</blockquote><blockquote>The Apostle Paul called us ‘fools for Christ’, and I’ve always imagined he said it with a lopsided grin, a little dazed by the gorgeous insanity of it all. We are ordinary men and women aflame with immortality and moonstruck mad by a grace we can scarcely fathom. We believe crazy things and we do crazy things as a result. We are loved outrageously, beyond all wisdom and reason, and we can’t keep the joy of the joke to ourselves. The love of God has wrung all manner of impossible things from of the hearts of His people since the world began. And how much lovelier is the world because of it.</blockquote>I hope I can write like that when I grow up.
