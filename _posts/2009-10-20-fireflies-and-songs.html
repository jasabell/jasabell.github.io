I have written about <a href="http://www.saragroves.com/">Sara Groves</a> in this space <a href="http://theabellsix.blogspot.com/2007/05/just-showed-up-for-my-own-life.html">before</a>. She is easily in my top five favorite musicians, if not the top three. Her music never fails to elicit some deep-seated emotion in me.<br /><br />The two big ones so far are <span style="font-style: italic;">Fireflies and Songs</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">It's Me</span>.<br /><br />Her brand new album, <span style="font-style: italic;">Fireflies and Songs</span>, is set to be released on November 17, 2009. For 10 bucks you can have <a href="https://secure.discrevolt.net/presale.aspx?subdomain=saragroves&amp;NR=0">instant gratification</a> and download them now. Please note this link will probably break after November 17.
