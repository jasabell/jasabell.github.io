She has put up with a lot in the last 20 years. She is God's greatest physical embodiment of mercy, grace, forgiveness, love, joy, partnership, and perseverance to me. I can more easily believe that God is real and good by looking at the gift of my wife. I exalt Christ and thank him for her, all the while striving (not so well) to love her like Christ loved the church (Eph 5:25-33).<div><br /></div><div>Happy Anniversary, my love.</div>
