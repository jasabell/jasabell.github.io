I have thought a lot lately about how I should be ministering better to the non-Christians I have contact with, as well as the Christians that I have the privilege to teach at church. The practical suggestion at the bottom of this quote from <a href="http://www.credenda.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=119:word-and-spirit&amp;catid=98:church&amp;Itemid=122">Sumpter</a> seems right. I hope that my ministry, whether at <a href="http://www.bethlehemcollegeandseminary.org/">BCS</a> or teaching on Wednesday nights, or somewhere else will be characterized by this earthy, humble, reality.<br /><blockquote>This means that Christian ministry must have Spirit-glorified flesh. So how do we gin up the Spirit? Which songs must we sing, which liturgy should we follow, how do we get the Spirit to incarnate our words, the gospel words we speak to those around us? Part of the answer is that it’s impossible, and that we cannot “get” the Spirit to do anything. The Spirit blows where He wishes, and we do not know His plans or intentions. But we do have the Scriptures, and we know the ways that the Spirit tends to work. The Spirit likes weakness. The Spirit glorifies the humble. The Spirit carves life out of the dirt. One practical suggestion is that Christian ministry needs to embrace the weakness of human flesh. Pastors and elders and parents must learn to hug and kiss and cry and shout and plead. The Word has to sink down into our earth, our bodily earth, into our emotions, our passions, our bodies in order to spring up into newness of human life.</blockquote>Read the <a href="http://www.credenda.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=119:word-and-spirit&amp;catid=98:church&amp;Itemid=122">whole thing</a>.
