Some days, the seriousness of life makes me want to cry.  At those times, and others, of course, a little laugh-out-loud satire is pleasant.<br /><blockquote>But in the meantime, we must not overlook the fact that she [Sarah Palin] presents an absolutely devastating challenge to the feminist narrative for women, and there are no <span style="font-style:italic;">mights</span> involved. Here is a woman who (for the sake of principle) has refused to sacrifice those things which feminists insist (in principle) must be sacrificed so that women can reach their "full potential." As a result of refusing the central dogma of their feminism, she might well become the first woman president. That'll do something to your little leftist narrative. Feminism has never been about advancing the cause of women. This reveals, as few other things could, that it has been about advancing the cause of <span style="font-style:italic;">commie</span> women.<br /><br />Granting that Sarah Palin does not look like June Cleaver, she looks a lot less like Hillary or Gloria Steinem. And, despite the differences, I can imagine Sarah and June having a very pleasant lunch together. If she tried to take Hillary or Gloria out shopping (for motorcyles, say) and a spot of lunch afterwards, all I can envision is stoney silences and a lot of glaring . . . and not from Sarah, who would be chatting happily. Sarah Palin ruffles the hair of some conservatives, but they can always comb it again. Doug Phillips will be all right in a couple days. In contrast, when it comes to the vampirism of the feminist left, let's just call her Buffy. They <span style="font-style:italic;">won't</span> be all right in a couple of days.</blockquote><br />For the whole Douglas Wilson blog post, which is quite lengthy, click <a href="http://www.dougwils.com/index.asp?Action=Anchor&CategoryID=1&BlogID=5845">here</a>.
