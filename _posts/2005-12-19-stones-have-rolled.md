Today was a momentous day this week.  I stayed up Sunday night and worked on my paper.  At 5:00 am this morning, Wendy looked up from bed, looked at me working at my computer, and said, "Have you not come to bed yet?"  I turned around and said, "Five more minutes!"  I crawled into bed at 5:15 am with a major draft completed.  It is due tomorrow night, so I still have to revise the paper and interact with secondary sources, but at least the draft is done.<br /><br />This afternoon, the other major problem in my life went away.  That is a significant praise.  Enough said.  At least I don't have to go to the doctor....<br /><br />We heard Vancouver had a bit of snow.  It must be cute out there.
