One of my elders at Bethlehem is one of those Godly men that you point to when someone asks you what a Christian is. At this point in my life, I know I don't trust Christ as much as he does. I pray that if and when I face suffering that God will be gracious to give me a heart like Mitch's. Here is what Mitch posted last night on his wife’s <a href="http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/marypearson">Caring Bridge</a> site.<br /><blockquote>There are times when the  question why is not going to be answered. We just need to move forward  trusting in the path God leads us. The LORD gives and the LORD takes  way; blessed be the name of the LORD. At  6:39pm on May 14th my beautiful wife while in my arms, went to be with  the LORD. As only God could plan Phillip, Emily, Cassie  and I were all present when the LORD took her from us. Janelle  was at one of her friend’s house and we were able to get her soon after  and we gathered around our Mom, my Wife and prayed for the mercy,  grace, and strength to move forward. It is strange how  fast things change, and over the last few days we knew the treatment was  not going as planned. There is only so much a body can  take and after fifteen and a half months of chemo, drugs, and  infections, her weakened body could take no more. The nurses and the  Doctor tried to do all they could, but Jesus was calling and Mary  answered. Please continue to keep us in your prayers. The  days ahead will be difficult and we will need to make many adjustments. We are thankful to be the children of  God. We have a hope in things to come when we will put on  an imperishable body when things like Leukemia will be gone forever. We will have no more tears, no more  death, and we will reign in His kingdom, worshiping the King with Mary and all the saints forever.<br /><br />Worshiping through tears,<br /><br />Mitch, Phil, Emily, Cassie, and Janelle</blockquote>
