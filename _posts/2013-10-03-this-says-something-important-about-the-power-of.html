<blockquote>This says something important about the power of story. Whoever seizes control of the story controls the debate—and actual facts become secondary. Another tragic aspect of the Matthew Shepard story is that his murder has been hijacked to serve a cause. And Hicklin actually admits this in his article, when he writes: “There are valuable reasons for telling certain stories in a certain way at pivotal times, but that doesn’t mean we have to hold on to them once they’ve outlived their usefulness.”</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://www.breakpoint.org/bpcommentaries/entry/13/23479">John Stonestreet</a>
I realize this article is about more than this paragraph lets on, but the comment on the power of story is what is interesting and powerful.
