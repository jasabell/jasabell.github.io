After much prayer and discussion, Wendy and I decided that we would extend our time in TBI to three years.  The Bethlehem Institute is set up to be a two year program, with the option of a third year extension.  Essentially, the second year of work is split into two halves.<br /><br />So, next year my classes will include Preaching, Jonathan Edwards, Practical Theology and Galatians.  The third year will include Hebrew (eight week summer course), Hebrew Exegesis, Genesis 1-4, and a yet undetermined Greek Bible exegesis course.<br /><br />This will put off the final completion of an MDiv for another year, but the value of a less hectic schedule and increased time to study and reflect, as well as more time to be with Wendy and kids is too much to pass up.
