I just finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/N.-D.-Wilson/e/B002E4BLI0/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1">N. D. Wilson’s</a> latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chestnut-King-Book-100-Cupboards/dp/0375838856/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1266701458&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Chestnut King</span></a>. Wow. It was fantastic. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Chestnut King</span> was the third and final installment in the 100 Cupboards series of children’s books; however, they are not your mother’s children’s books. There is magic, suspense, swords, good, evil, love, and baseball—all of which you would expect. But the evil is <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> evil, and the blood is <span style="font-style: italic;">spilt</span> blood, and the hero—a twelve year old boy—does some of the spilling. Don’t let that stop you from reading. Instead, remember what C. S. Lewis said about <a href="http://theabellsix.blogspot.com/2009/06/let-there-be-wicked-kings-and.html">that</a>.<br /><br />One of the things—in my world anyway—which signals that a story, whether book or movie, was good is how long it sticks with me after it is over. If I am still thinking about it two days after it is over, then it was good. I think this is going to be that kind of book. I had an emotional bond with Henry York Maccabee and his family. I feel a loss having finished the book. I want to know more. I don’t want it to be over.<br /><br />Now, there are only a handful of people who read this blog, mostly because I put it in your RSS feed. So, you know what I mean when I say that you are all working too much and should take a little time out to read a good book, or three. If reading a children’s book sounds beneath you, then you also need to remember what C.S. Lewis said about <a href="http://theabellsix.blogspot.com/2009/06/no-apology-for-good-kids-books.html">that</a>. Go out and read this series. Now.
