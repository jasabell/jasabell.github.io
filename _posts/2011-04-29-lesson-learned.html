This is a repost from Justin Taylor’s <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/between2worlds/~3/-Du9k6G8nTo/">Between Two Worlds</a>:<br /><blockquote>From an <a href="http://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/holding-line-interview-r-albert-mohler-jr/">interview</a> with with Albert Mohler in <i>TableTalk</i> magazine:</blockquote><blockquote><b>Although there are many, is there one lesson the Lord has taught you that you would care to share with us?</b></blockquote><blockquote>I think the one great lesson the Lord has taught me over these years is that the importance of the family and the local congregation supersedes every other relationship to which the Christian is called. Christians demonstrate the glory of God and the power of the gospel by the way we marry and stay married, by the way we raise our children, by the way we love each other, and by the way we live faithfully in the congregation of believers. In the end, I fear that far too much energy is devoted to and far too many hopes are invested in institutions, programs, and projects that will not last. The centrality of Christ’s purpose to glorify himself in His church and the blessings of God that are directed to the precious gift of the family — these far exceed our other allegiances.</blockquote>(HT: <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justintaylor/">JT</a>)
