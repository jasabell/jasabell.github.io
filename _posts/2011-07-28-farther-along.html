I heard about the new <a href="http://www.joshgarrels.com/">Josh Garrels</a> album, <i>Love &amp; War &amp; The Sea In Between</i>, from <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/2011/07/josh-garrels-love-war-the-sea-in-between/">The Rabbit Room</a>, NoiseTrade, and a friend at nearly the same time. I have been listening to it constantly now for days. I love it.<br /><br />Josh Garrels appears to be one of those radical Christians who trusts in God to the point of sacrifice. He is giving away the album for free—I guess that is what <i>giving away</i> means—for a year, both electronic and physical versions.<br /><br />I highly encourage you to go and download this album. If you love it as much as I do, please donate (visit the store on his <a href="http://www.joshgarrels.com/">website</a>). This is the kind of music that Christians should be listening to rather than the pop driven, mindless drivel played on so many other Christian outlets.<br /><br />My favorite song so far is <i>Farther Along</i>:<br /><br /><b>Farther Along</b><br /><br />Farther along we’ll know all about it<br />Farther along we’ll understand why<br />Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine<br />We’ll understand this, all by and by<br /><br />Tempted and tried, I wondered why<br />The good man died, the bad man thrives<br />And Jesus cries because he loves em’ both<br />We’re all cast-aways in need of ropes<br />Hangin’ on by the last threads of our hope<br />In a house of mirrors full of smoke<br />Confusing illusions I’ve seen<br /><br />Where did I go wrong, I sang along<br />To every chorus of the song<br />That the devil wrote like a piper at the gates<br />Leading mice and men down to their fates<br />But some will courageously escape<br />The seductive voice with a heart of faith<br />While walkin’ that line back home<br /><br />So much more to life than we’ve been told<br />It’s full of beauty that will unfold<br />And shine like you struck gold my wayward son<br />That deadweight burden weighs a ton<br />Go down into the river and let it run<br />And wash away all the things you’ve done<br />Forgiveness alright<br /><br /><i>Chorus</i><br /><br />Still I get hard pressed on every side<br />Between the rock and a compromise<br />Like the truth and pack of lies fightin’ for my soul<br />And I’ve got no place left go<br />Cause I got changed by what I’ve been shown<br />More glory than the world has known<br />Keeps me ramblin’ on<br /><br />Skipping like a calf loosed from its stall<br />I’m free to love once and for all<br />And even when I fall I’ll get back up<br />For the joy that overflows my cup<br />Heaven filled me with more than enough<br />Broke down my levee and my bluff<br />Let the flood wash me<br /><br />And one day when the sky rolls back on us<br />Some rejoice and the others fuss<br />Cause every knee must bow and tongue confess<br />That the son of god is forever blessed<br />His is the kingdom, we’re the guests<br />So put your voice up to the test<br />Sing Lord, come soon<br /><br /><i>Chorus</i>
