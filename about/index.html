    <p>
	    I am a Christian, husband, and father.
	    I have adopted my church's mission statement for my life:
	    "I exist to spread a passion for the supremacy of God in
	    all things for the joy of all peoples through Jesus Christ."
	    I live this mission poorly, screwing up all along the way,
	    yet trusting in the Jesus of the Christian scriptures for
	    life and breath and everything.
    </p>

	    I was a civil engineer, I thought I would pastor, now I
	    administrate at <a href="http://bcsmn.edu">Bethlehem College
		& Seminary</a> in Minneapolis, MN. I have a mediocre blog
		that includes thoughts, quotes, and other stuff probably
		only I care about. I have written some stuff, but not enough
		that's very good. I have also preached a few times.
