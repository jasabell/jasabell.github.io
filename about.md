Why would someone want to create a webpage about themselves? I’m not sure. I just want to create a webpage, but can’t think about anything worthy to create a webpage about. So, I thought I would create this page as a hobby so I could dabble in computer stuff.

In earlier years I had blogged on Blogspot and then tried to create a commonplace book on Tumblr. Both were fun, but I didn’t keep them up.

So, using Jekyll and Github, I thought I would try to pull my disparate sites together in to one place.

Here it is, for better or worse.
