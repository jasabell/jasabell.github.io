	    Why would someone want to create a website about themselves?
	    I’m not sure. I just wanted to create a static page website
	    sans CMS, but couldn't think of anything to create a site about.
	    So, I created this hobby site wherein I could dabble in various
	    backend computer stuff. In earlier years I had a blog on Blogger
	    and even tried to create a commonplace book on Tumblr. Both were
	    fun, but I didn’t keep them up. So, using <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>
	    and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, I thought I would try
	    to pull my disparate sites together into one place. I have relied
	    heavily on <a href="http://www.ybrikman.com">Yevgeniy Brikman</a> for
	    my site design. All good design is his. All screw-ups are mine.
	    This is it, for better or worse.
